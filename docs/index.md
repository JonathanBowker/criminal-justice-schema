# What is Fides Case Definition Language?
### Standardised. Interoperable. Efficient.

Fides (_pronounced /fee-dhez/, from Latin: Fidēs - the goddess of trust, faithfulness, and good faith_) is a  **Criminal Case Definition Language** based on the [Criminal Justice System Exchange Data Standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/criminal-justice-system-data-standards-forum-guidance). It serves as a structured language that categorises, codes, and facilitates the safe and consistent processing of criminal justice data with generative artificial intelligence (AI).

Fides provides a standardised and human-readable format for managing data transfers between individuals, information management systems, and artificial intelligence (AI). It is simple, flexible, and extendable, using tools that are freely accessible.

**Fides** is an open-source, **human- and machine-readable** language for defining justice-related datasets, behaviours, and usage patterns. Developed by experts in data management and AI, legal professionals, and forensic analysts, Fides supports the integration of case and evidence data with AI models to ensure that justice-related data remains consistent, accessible, and secure. By providing a unified format, Fides enables effective communication between individuals, information management systems, and AI technologies.
