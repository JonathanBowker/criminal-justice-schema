# Getting Started with Judicial Electronic Data Interchange (JEDI) language 

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for implementing JEDI within your criminal trial case management system.

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of NoSQL databases e.g. Firebase, MongoDB, Elasticsearch.
- Knowledge of JSON or YAML for structuring data.
- Access to an appropriate database environment.

## Installation

1. Clone the JEDI repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JonathanBowker/judicial-electronic-data-interchange.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd judicial-electronic-data-interchange
   ```

3. Follow any additional setup instructions in the repositoryâ€™s README file to install dependencies and set up your environment.

## Additional Considerations
- Integrate JEDI with existing databases and applications using the provided guidelines and integration examples.
- Explore sample code snippets demonstrating how to set up the schema in various environments (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch).

# Schema Overview

The Judicial Electronic Data Interchange (JEDI) language  schema is organized into several key components, each representing a distinct aspect of criminal trial cases. The schema includes:

- **Case Details**: Information related to the case, such as the case ID, type, jurisdiction, and current status.
- **Participants**: Data on individuals involved in the trial, including defendants, judges, attorneys, and witnesses.
- **Evidence Details**: Metadata covering different types of evidence, including physical, digital, and testimonial, along with information on the chain of custody.
- **Court Proceedings**: Information on court events such as hearings, motions, court orders, and verdicts.

Each component is designed to ensure comprehensive data capture, facilitating interoperability and consistency across various justice systems.
