# Usage Guidelines

The **Usage Guidelines** provide information on how to effectively use the Judicial Electronic Data Interchange Language (JEDI) for managing and documenting criminal justice data. This page outlines best practices for recording, maintaining, and querying information using the schema, ensuring consistency, data accuracy, and adherence to legal and privacy standards.

## Overview

The JEDI is designed to standardise the management of criminal justice information across various entities such as law enforcement agencies, court systems, probation and parole services, and victim support services. It offers a flexible and extensible structure that accommodates different types of cases and supports integration with other systems, including evidence and forensic management.

### Objectives

- **Standardisation**: Promote consistency in recording criminal justice data across various entities and jurisdictions.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that data entered into the system is accurate and complete.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitate data sharing and integration with other criminal justice systems.
- **Efficiency**: Streamline data entry processes and reduce duplication.
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with legal standards and data protection regulations.

## Best Practices for Using the JEDI

### 1. Consistent Data Entry

Maintaining consistency in data entry is crucial for the effective use of the JEDI:

- **Follow Field Definitions**: Ensure that all data entries conform to the definitions provided for each field in the schema. For example, always use the specified format for dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Use Standardised Codes**: For fields like `case.type` or `offense.type`, use predefined codes or keywords (e.g., `criminal`, `civil`, `theft`, `assault`) to maintain uniformity.
- **Mandatory Fields**: Fill in all mandatory fields, such as `case.id`, `participant.id`, and `event.date`, to avoid incomplete records.

### 2. Data Validation

Implement data validation processes to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information:

- **Automatic Validation**: Use software tools to automatically validate entries, such as checking that dates are in the correct format or ensuring that numeric fields (e.g., `bail.amount`) are within acceptable ranges.
- **Manual Review**: Periodically conduct manual reviews of records to identify and correct any errors or inconsistencies.

### 3. Maintaining Data Privacy and Security

Since criminal justice data is highly sensitive, it's essential to follow strict security protocols:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to control who can access or modify different types of information, based on their role (e.g., police officers, court clerks, legal professionals).
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorised access.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed logs of data access and modification activities to track and investigate any suspicious behaviour.

### 4. Updating and Maintaining Records

To keep information accurate and up-to-date:

- **Timely Updates**: Update records promptly when new information becomes available (e.g., changing a case status from `open` to `closed` once a ruling is made).
- **Version Control**: Use version control mechanisms to track changes made to records, enabling you to see historical data or revert to previous versions if necessary.
- **Periodic Audits**: Conduct periodic audits of the database to identify and address any discrepancies or outdated information.

## Managing Evidence and Forensics

The JEDI supports the detailed management of evidence and forensic information, which is critical in criminal investigations and legal proceedings.

### 1. Recording and Tracking Evidence

When documenting evidence, ensure the following:

- **Unique Identification**: Each piece of evidence should have a unique identifier (`evidence.id`) to maintain traceability across the case lifecycle.
- **Evidence Type**: Specify the type of evidence (e.g., physical, digital, testimonial) using the `evidence.type` field to categorise evidence accurately.
- **Chain of Custody**: Maintain a detailed record of the evidence’s chain of custody, including dates, locations, and individuals responsible for handling it (`evidence.chain_of_custody`).
- **Evidence Location**: Track where the evidence is stored (e.g., police evidence locker) using the `evidence.location` field.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Record forensic examination results and the techniques used (e.g., DNA analysis, fingerprint matching) in the `evidence.forensic_details` field.

### 2. Forensic Documentation and Analysis

Accurate forensic documentation is critical for legal proceedings:

- **Detailed Forensic Reports**: Ensure all forensic activities are documented in reports that reference `evidence.id` for clarity and linkage.
- **Result Consistency**: Document results and their interpretations consistently, including confidence levels and methodologies (e.g., "DNA match with 99% certainty").
- **Cross-Referencing with Events**: Link forensic activities with the events they relate to (e.g., `event.id`), such as crime scene processing or laboratory analysis.

### 3. Integrating Generative AI for Evidence and Forensics

Generative AI and LLMs can support evidence management and forensic analysis:

- **AI-Powered Evidence Review**: Automate the review of evidence files using LLMs to summarise forensic findings or flag relevant details.
- **Predictive Forensic Analysis**: Use AI models to predict outcomes based on forensic data, such as the likelihood of suspect involvement based on DNA or fingerprint matches.
- **Evidence Classification**: LLMs can classify and tag evidence based on case type and relevance, improving retrieval and organisation.

## Common Use Cases

The JEDI can be applied in various scenarios within the criminal justice system:

### 1. Law Enforcement Records Management

- **Arrests and Offenses**: Record information about arrests, offenses, and evidence collected using the schema’s fields (`enforcement.id`, `offense.type`, etc.).
- **Evidence Tracking**: Document evidence collection, chain of custody, and forensic details to ensure reliability and traceability throughout the investigation.
- **Event Logging**: Log significant events such as interrogations, searches, and warrant executions using the `event` fields.

### 2. Court Case Management

- **Case Documentation**: Document case details, including participants, events, and judicial procedures, ensuring all necessary data (e.g., `case.judge_ids`, `judicial_procedure.id`) is recorded.
- **Forensic Testimonies**: Link forensic evidence and expert witness testimonies to the cases they support, ensuring transparency and traceability.
- **Sentencing and Bail**: Record information related to bail and sentencing, including conditions and enforcement details (`bail_detention.conditions`, `sentence.duration`).

### 3. Victim Support Services

- **Victim Assistance Tracking**: Track the provision of support services to victims using `victim_support` fields (e.g., `victim_support.type`, `victim_support.provider`).
- **Service Documentation**: Record start and end dates of support services, ensuring that all provided assistance is documented for accountability and reporting.

### 4. Probation and Parole Management

- **Supervision Details**: Document probation and parole conditions, including the duration, required check-ins, and assigned supervisor (`probation_parole.supervisor`).
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Record and track compliance events, such as missed check-ins or violations of parole terms.

## Querying the Schema

Using the JEDI effectively involves querying and retrieving information based on specific criteria:

### 1. Basic Queries

- **Find a Case by ID**: Retrieve case details using `case.id` to find information like status, participants, and related documents.
- **List Offenses by Type**: Query for all offenses of a specific type, such as `theft` or `assault`, using `offense.type`.
- **Filter Events by Date Range**: Retrieve events within a specified time period using the `event.date` field.
- **Search for Evidence**: Query evidence records by type or related forensic results using `evidence.id` and `evidence.type`.

### 2. Advanced Queries

- **Cross-Entity Queries**: Combine data from multiple entities (e.g., cases, participants, offenses) to gain insights. For example, find all participants involved in cases related to a specific judge using `case.judge_ids`.
- **Forensic Analysis Retrieval**: Retrieve forensic details linked to specific events or cases, ensuring all relevant forensic activities are accessible.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Use generative AI and LLMs to summarise case details, forensic reports, or generate insights based on historical data patterns.
