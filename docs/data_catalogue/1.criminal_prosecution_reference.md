Here's the updated version of the `criminal_prosecution_reference.md` file, incorporating all related entities as they may connect to or relate with the `criminal_prosecution_reference` dataset.

# Criminal Prosecution Reference Dataset

The `criminal_prosecution_reference` dataset holds information about the prosecution process within criminal cases. This includes identifiers that link defendants to specific offences and their sequences, ensuring the preparation and management of prosecutions. These fields ensure comprehensive documentation and tracking of prosecution activities within the justice system.

## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains attributes such as links to person or organisation records, offence codes, and offence sequences, offering a comprehensive record of prosecution activities associated with cases. It serves as the primary entity that connects and integrates all other related datasets within the Fides system.
