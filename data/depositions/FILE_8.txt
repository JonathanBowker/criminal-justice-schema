1. 
I am a Senior Forensic Investigator at Diligence International, a group specialising in forensic video, imagery, audio, computers, mobile devices, questioned documents and cell site analysis. I am a founder member of the Forensic Imagery Analysis Group (now FIAD). I am listed in the UK Register of Expert Witnesses and was registered in Imaging with the CRFP. 

2. 
I hold a Bachelor of Science Degree, a BTEC HNC and ONG in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I am a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering & Technology. I served in the Royal Navy for 25 years, undertaking a broad spectrum of Electronic Engineering work. The culmination of my naval career was as the Weapons Engineer Officer of a Nuclear Submarine. 

3. 
From 1999 to June 2008 I was employed by Control Risks Forensics as the senior video consultant, before establishing my own consultancy, Infra Tech Forensics. From April to December 2019 I was employed by BAE Systems before returning to the forensic profession. I specialise in providing expertise in the enhancement and authentication of video material and image analysis. I have successfully completed the Police Air Reconnaissance Imagery Analysis Course at the Joint School of Photographic Interpretation, 

4. 
Shortly after the 7 /7 London Bombings, I carried out the processing of Police & Security Services surveillance video material in support of the Court Presentation of OPERATION CREVICE (R v Omar Khyam & others.) I have provided expertise and support pertaining to the analysis, enhancement and authentication of video and audio material, image analysis and comparison of faces, clothing, vehicles and firearms. In addition I have carried out compilation editing, subject tracking, dynamic event analysis, person height analysis, object identification and video reconstructions. I have applied these skills in many criminal and some civil cases, for both the prosecution and defence. I have given evidence in the Royal Courts of Justice, the Central Criminal Court, the High Court of the Justiciary, Crown, Magistrates and Coroner's Courts, I have lectured to police detective sergeant training courses.

INSTRUCTION 
5. 
This report is produced in continuation of earlier discussions with PSNI by my former colleague Matthew James Stephens (MJS) who has moved on in his career. 

6. 
In summary, the CClV recordings show suspects who are believed to be involved in the murder of Ian Ogle. The footage has been separated and collated into different folders according to the locations and dates of the recordings. 

7. 
Using subject identifiers (supplied by PSNI), Diligence has been instructed to compare subjects' clothing from CClV video footage. For Male 3 these are folders 


> ) 2,10J and12. 
8. 
To maintain the avoidance of contextual bias, I have only received the minimum amount of information required to complete the instructions. PSNI assigned person/subject identifiers rather than proving suspect names. I have allocated letters to the male subjects recorded by the bus shelter camera in Albertbridge Road. The subject of interest in this group being Man E. 

9. 
Although Diligence has received instructions from PSNI, this report is prepared for Court purposes if required. 


1 O. I confirm that I have read and understand my duties in relation to the requirements of Part 19 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015 and a signed declaration to that effect is appended to this report. 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
11. 
The clothing comparison does not identify any irreconcilable differences that would allow me to exclude the PSNI proposition that Male 3 is the same person at the bank and the bus shelter. 

12. 
Male 3's jacket is similar to the type worn by Man E in the bus shelter footage. Man E's hat is the same type and manufacture as hat 2019012701303-DT10. 


DJLIGFNCE 
Page5 
19189v_PSNI/MJB/3 

13. 
The image quality from the bank CCTV is very good, where the overall style and detail in Man 3's jacket may be seen. 

14. 
The lighting conditions in the bus shelter footage are different to the bank, which may explain the apparent difference in the colour of the jacket. 


Levels of Support 
15. The conclusions will normally be expressed using terminology endorsed by the Forensic Image Analysis Division (FIAD) detailed in Appendix A, as either: 
a) 
A statement that, on the basis of irreconcilable differences, the two (2) subjects or objects being compared are not the same and are therefore EXCLUDED from further contention. 

b) 
A statement of the degree of support the analysis lends for the contention that the two (2) subjects or objects are the same, as outlined below: 

Lends NO SUPPORT Lends LIMITED SUPPORT Lends MODERATE SUPPORT Lends SUPPORT Lends STRONG SUPPORT Lends POWERFUL SUPPORT 

c) 
This scale of conclusion was devised by FIAD in response to requests from the Judiciary for standardisation of experts' opinions in Imagery Analysis evidence. Earlier concluding evidence had been known to cause confusion. Even where experts agreed on matters, their scales of support or use of terminology appeared to show differences of opinion. 


16. The widely adopted scale provides guidance to our findings with an easily interpreted level; but it should be noted that there are no defined thresholds between levels of the scale and that, in instances where two (2) experts conclude with an adjacent level 


DILIGENCE 
Page6 
19189v_PSN!/MJB/3 
of support (rather than the same level), there will be much common ground in their findings. 'Polar opposites' between experts' conclusions will imply a degree of disagreement in their findings or interpretation. 
17. 
The absence of statistical analysis in imagery comparison exercises is such that percentages or numerical values cannot be used to express our findings. For example, 'Powerful Support' does not infer a one-hundred percent (100%) match. 

18. 
I reserve the right to vary the terminology when to do so would more accurately express my conclusions. 



EXAMINATION OF EXHIBITS 
19. From the CCTV folders I have gathered the video files in a professional grade video editing suite for subsequent analysis using Adobe Premiere Pro. Some of the still images extracted from the motion video have had light enhancement (sharpening, brightness and contrast adjustment) carried out in Adobe Photoshop CC. 
IMAGE ANALYSIS 
20. 
By specifying the intended comparisons, PSNI have put forward a series of propositions that Male 3 is the person recoded throughout. In order to address and ultimately avoid contextual bias, I collated the observable features and compared the findings. Interpretation of the imagery is based on the analysis of all relevant disclosed imagery available to me. 

21. 
The images are reproduced in an annex to this report exhibited as MJB/3A. 

22. 
Other than the footage from Folder 2, the Bank of Ireland, the supplied incident video evidence does not lend itself to facial comparison because of the 'limitations of the imagery', such as the video resolution, distance from camera to subject, ambient lighting levels and movement of the subject and motion blur. The clothing comparisons are constrained by the same limitations, but the opportunity to detect clear similarities or significant differences is possible.

23. The Albertbridge Bus Shelter camera provides a fish-eye, downward looking view. Using the player software supplied, I was unable to "warp" the view to a more useful picture. 
Exhibits Produced. 
24. I produced a four page document of still images of Male 3 which I introduce as exhibit 19156V_PSNI/MJB/3A. I compared the clothing of Male 3 as follows. 

Appearance & Clothing 
Jacket 
d) 
In the Bank, Male 3 is wearing a green, waist length jacket that has a dark, full length vertical fastener (probably a zip) at the front. There is a small light shape on a dark background at the upper right side of the chest. This is highlighted in yellow on page 2 of MJB/3A. The jacket has a raised collar with dark marks at each side. At the left and right sides of the collar are intermittent light shapes that are highlighted in blue. 

e) 
In the bus shelter footage, Man Eis wearing the same style of jacket that appears to be blue in colour. Clothing often reacts differently according to the lighting conditions, therefore this is not sufficient to allow an exclusion to be made. The similarities are that: 


1) Man E's jacket has a dark, full length fastener at the front. 
2) A light mark at the upper right of the chest or shoulder area that is highlighted in yellow. 
3) A small raised collar with a light area highlighted in blue. 
fj Differences: When going towards Cluan Place, there are light areas at the front left, higher up near the chin; these are not visible when Man E returns. When examining the bank footage in folder 2, there are momentary "flashes" on both 



DILIGENCE 
PageB 
19189v_PSNI/MJB/3 
sides of the jacket collar as the angle of the artificial light changes. These are not apparent differences but similarities between the bank and the bus shelter. 
Headwear 
g) In the bus shelter footage, Man E is wearing a dark blue, woolly bobble hat with a rectangular graphic at the front containing red, white and a dark colour. The PSNI have supplied me with a photographic image of a dark blue or black hat 2019012701303-DT10. This hat features a woollen Norwegian flag. Whilst this hat is probably a mass produced item, the distinct graphic allows the CClV images to lend powerful support to this being the same type and manufacture of hat. 

Footwear 
In the bus shelter footage, illustrated at page 3 of MJB/3A, Man E is wearing light or all white coloured training style shoes. Folder DT7 includes photographs of a similar pair of white trainers that have the following similarities: 
4) Flat plimsoll style. 
5) A dark Lacoste logo at the outer of the upper. Man E's right shoe has a corresponding faint dark mark at the right side. 
6) Lacing panel that curves towards the sides. 
7) A "Foxing Band" strengthening area at the front. 
25. The only similarity for Male 3 in the bank and Man E at the bus shelter is the overall style of the jacket. 
CONCLUSIONS 
26. The clothing comparison does not identify any irreconcilable differences that would allow me to exclude the PSNI proposition that Male 3 is the same person in both video clips. 
DILIGENCE 

Page9 19189v_PSNI I MJB13 
27. 
The images lends strong support to the contention that the jacket top worn by Male 3 in the bank is the same type of jacket as worn by Man E in the bus shelter footage. It has the same overall style and light feature at the upper right chest. The apparent difference in colour means it is either a different item or it may be explained by the artificial lighting. 

28. 
The images of the hat worn by Man E in the bus shelter footage lend powerful support to this being the same type and manufacture of hat as hat 2019012701303-DT10. 

29. 
The images of the shoes worn by Man E in the bus shelter footage lend strong support to these being the same type and manufacture of shoes as the Lacoste shoes photographed in folder OT?. 

30. 
These conclusions reference mass-produced articles of clothing. This support is for the contention that they are the same overall type, design and manufacture of article. In the absence of any visible uniquely-identifying features, the articles worn by the subject cannot be differentiated from any other article of the same design. 

31. 
I reserve the right to review my conclusions should I be permitted access to additional imagery evidence at a later date.

ACCREDITATION 
32. Diligence International operates a quality management system that has achieved accreditation to ISO9001 :2015 and a security management system that has achieved accreditation to ISO27001:2013. We embrace the requirements of ISO:17025 and work in line with them where applicable however as a small specialist provider in a number of forensic disciplines, often provided at legal aid rates, accreditation to ISO:17025 for each discipline and procedure within that discipline is prohibitively expensive at this time.

Appendix A -Guidance for Evaluating Levels of Support 
This guidance note is endorsed by the Forensic Imagery Analysis Division (FIAD) within the British Association of Human Identification (BAHID). The purpose of the note is to provide broad guidance to lawyers and others seeking to understand the use of Levels of Support, and, in general terms, how any stated conclusion may be justified. The note is non-binding on practitioners and it is the strong opinion of the group that it is the expert's professional duty to evaluate each case independently and draw conclusions based upon this guidance note, their own professional experience and any prevalence statistics or other evidence that is relevant to the case and contained within, or referred to, in their report. 
For each of the levels of support, it is not possible to indicate a specific number of required similarities as the factors of most importance differ from case to case. The levels of support should not be seen as a 'stepped' or mutually exclusive set of categories but rather a continuous spectrum whereby each level blends into the next and no distinct cut-off point can be defined. 
It is important to note that the comparisons undertaken do not require satisfying each of the criteria for each level of support. For example, in the case of 'Powerful Support' the images may be of very good quality, with a high level of observable detail but an assessment of relative geometry may not necessarily have been undertaken. 
It is also important to note that the Levels of Support can be used in order to express the weight of imagery evidence that two persons imaged are not one and the same. For example, it may be that differences can be seen between imagery of an unknown person and the suspect/defendant. These differences might not be sufficient to justify the elimination of the suspect, but may raise such concern that a conclusion of moderate support that the two persons are not one and the same is appropriate. 
This note is not definitive. It has been prepared to provide guidance on conclusions in cases of facial comparisons, although the Levels of Support are also widely used in other types of comparative interpretation. The following factors are taken into account when defining each level of the scale: 
� 
The image quality 

� 
The number of facial feature similarities/differences observed 

� 
The number of different times the similarities/differences can be observed, 

� 
Whether or not a comparison of relative geometry can be made, and the closeness of any correlation or difference 

� 
The number of different viewpoints available 

� 
Individual significance attributed to a distinct correlation or difference of a given feature, or several features in combination 

� 
The presence/absence of marks, scars and blemishes 



DILIGENCE

19189v_PSNI /MJB/3 


No support 
� 
The imagery is too poor to permit a sufficiently robust comparison from which to form an expert opinion. 

� 
There is sufficient detail from which to form an expert opinion, but the results are such that the similarities are countered by differences, making the imagery evidence uncertain and inconclusive. 

� 
There may be very general characteristics observable (i.e. race, gender, hair colour), but these features do not offer enough support towards specific identity, for an expert to make a more meaningful comparison than a lay person. It would be unsafe to offer any support towards the contention that the two persons under comparison are one and the same using facial image comparison methodology. 


Limited support 
� 
The image quality does not allow for the detail of features to be seen. 

� 
The imagery allows for detail to be seen, but obscuration (hood, hat, scarf etc.) prevents a comprehensive comparison. 

� 
There are a few general characteristics observable, these would include descriptors such as broad nose, moderately protrusive ears etc. Individually or in combination, these features only allow for a 'superficial' comparison. The ability to discriminate between two people of similar general appearance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry* may or may not have been compared, but observation of identifiable landmarks is severely restricted by image quality. 

� 
Only one or two adequate images may be available for comparison. 


* An assessment of relative facial geometry requires that images of the crime perpetrator and the suspect are selected from the same viewpoints and scaled to be the same size. Alignment of the various landmarks (usually facial feature locations) observable, in each of the images, may reveal differences in the facial proportions or the sizes of the facial features between the two items of comparison. A comparison of facial geometry in this way is an assessment of the relative size, shape and position of the various facial features. Differences are more likely to be evident when the images are aligned on both horizontal and vertical axes rather than on one axis alone.

Moderate support 
� The image quality permits a moderate amount of facial feature detail to be discerned: 
i.e. visible features can be described; for example, the nose could be classified as having a narrow bridge and a straight ridge. 
� 
There are a few general facial features that can be compared. 

� 
Individually or in combination, the available imagery allows for a reasonably robust comparison. The ability to discriminate between two people of similar appearance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry may be matching, but the ability to precisely locate landmarks is restricted and may therefore be somewhat imprecise. 

� 
The comparison may be limited in terms of the number of images available. 




Support 
� 
The image quality permits individual features to be compared in detail and a confident interpretation and comparison can be made. 

� 
There are some facial features that can be compared in detail. It is likely that the facial similarities/differences will be evident on multiple images. However, they may also be observed on only one occasion depending on image quality. The similarities may or may not be observed in combination. 

� 
Individually or in combination, the available imagery allows for a robust comparison. It should be possible to make a distinction between two people of broadly similar appearance. However, the ability to discriminate between two people bearing a close resemblance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry may be matching, but the ability to precisely locate landmarks is restricted and may therefore be somewhat imprecise. An assessment of geometry is likely to be limited to one or two instances i.e. from one or two differing viewpoints. 

� 
The comparison would usually be based on multiple images to provide consistency and confidence of interpretation.

Strong support 

� 
The image quality permits a range of features to be compared in detail and a very confident interpretation and comparison can be made. 

� 
There are some facial features that can be compared in detail. It is likely that the facial similarities/differences will be evident on multiple images.

Individually or in combination, the available imagery allows for a robust comparison. It should be possible to make a distinction between two people of similar appearance. However, the ability to discriminate between two people bearing a very close resemblance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry may be matching; ii is possible to confidently locate landmarks. A confident assessment of geometry is likely to be available from multiple viewpoints. 

� 
The comparison would usually be based on multiple images showing good detail to provide consistency and confidence of interpretation. 

� 
A lesser strength of comparison may be augmented by similarities/differences in the location and size of tattoos, marks and scars, although fine detail of these features cannot be determined with confidence. 


Powerful support 
� 
The image quality permits a range of features to be compared in significant detail and an extremely confident interpretation and comparison can be made. 

� 
A significant number of facial features can be compared in detail. It is likely that these facial similarities/differences will be evident on multiple images. However, they may also be observed on only one occasion depending on image quality. The similarities may or may not be observed in combination. 

� 
Individually or in combination, the available imagery allows for a robust comparison. 11 should be possible to make a distinction between two people of very similar appearance. Two people would have to bear a striking resemblance in order for discrimination not to be possible. 

� 
Unless clearly justified by other aspects of the comparison, the assessment of (relative) facial geometry should be very robust, based on several landmarks that can be located with great confidence. A confident assessment of geometry is likely to be available from multiple viewpoints [notwithstanding comparisons based on high quality photography such as passports].

INSTRUCTION 
This report is produced in continuation of earlier discussions with PSNI by my former colleague Matthew James Stephens (MJS) who has moved on in his career. 
6. 
In summary, the CCTV recordings show suspects who are believed to be involved in the murder of Ian Ogle. The footage has been separated and collated into different folders according to the locations and dates of the recordings. 

7. 
Using subject identifiers (supplied by PSNI), Diligence has been instructed to compare subjects' clothing from CCTV video footage. For Male 4 these are folders 3 and 6, 1 O and 12. Also to comment on any weapon observed. 

8. 
To maintain the avoidance of contextual bias, I have only received the minimum amount of information required to complete the instructions. PSNI assigned person/subject identifiers rather than proving suspect names. I have allocated letters to the male subjects recorded by the bus shelter camera in Albertbridge Road. The subject of interest in this group being Man A.

1 O. I confirm that I have read and understand my duties in relation to the requirements of Part 19 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015 and a signed declaration to that effect is appended to this report. 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 
11
. The clothing comparison does not identify any irreconcilable differences that would allow me to exclude the PSNI proposition that Male 4 is the same person throughout. 

12. 
The images show similar dark blue or black tracksuit bottoms and training shoes in the shop (both on 27 January) and in the bus shelter footage.

13. The images lend support for the object carried being the same type of baton as the asp baton in the photographic images. 




COMMENT 
14. Shop CCTV images from 25 January, as shown on page 5 of MJB/4A, illustrate how a single item of clothing may appear to be a different colour according to the lighting conditions. This hooded top appears to be grey/green in some camera views and blue in others. 
Levels of Support 
15. The conclusions will normally be expressed using terminology endorsed by the Forensic Image Analysis Division (FIAD) detailed in Appendix A, as either: 
a. 
A statement that, on the basis of irreconcilable differences, the two (2) subjects or objects being compared are not the same and are therefore EXCLUDED from further contention. 

b. 
A statement of the degree of support the analysis lends for the contention that the two (2) subjects or objects are the same, as outlined below: 


Lends NO SUPPORT Lends LIMITED SUPPORT Lends MODERATE SUPPORT Lends SUPPORT Lends STRONG SUPPORT Lends POWERFUL SUPPORT 
c. This scale of conclusion was devised by FIAD in response to requests from the Judiciary for standardisation of experts' opinions in Imagery Analysis evidence. Earlier concluding evidence had been known to cause confusion. Even where experts agreed on matters, their scales of support or use of terminology appeared to show differences of opinion. 



Page6 
191891,1__PSNIIMJB/4 

16. 
The widely adopted scale provides guidance to our findings with an easily interpreted level; but it should be noted that there are no defined thresholds between levels of the scale and that, in instances where two (2) experts conclude with an adjacent level of support (rather than the same level), there will be much common ground in their findings. 'Polar opposites' between experts' conclusions will imply a degree of disagreement in their findings or interpretation. 

17. 
The absence of statistical analysis in imagery comparison exercises is such that percentages or numerical values cannot be used to express our findings. For example, 'Powerful Support' does not infer a one-hundred percent {100%) match. 

18. 
I reserve the right to vary the terminology when to do so would more accurately express my conclusions. 


EXAMINATION OF EXHIBITS 
19. 
From the CCTV folders I have gathered the video files in a professional grade video editing suite for subsequent analysis using Adobe Premiere Pro. Some of the still images extracted from the motion video have had light enhancement (sharpening, brightness and contrast adjustment) carried out in Adobe Photoshop CC. 

20. 
By specifying the intended comparisons, PSNI have put forward a series of propositions that Male 4 is the person recoded throughout. In order to address and ultimately avoid contextual bias, I collated the observable features and compared the findings. Interpretation of the imagery is based on the analysis of all relevant disclosed imagery available to me. 

21. 
The images are reproduced in an annex to this report exhibited as MJB/4A. 

22. 
Other than a short part of the footage from Folder 6, Russe/ls Shops, the supplied incident video evidence does not lend itself to facial comparison because of the 'limitations of the imagery', such as the video resolution, distance from camera to

subject, ambient lighting levels and movement of the subject and motion blur. The clothing comparisons are constrained by the same limitations, but the opportunity to detect clear similarities or significant differences is possible. 
23. The Albertbridge Bus Shelter camera provides a fish-eye, downward looking view. Using the player software supplied, I was unable to "warp" the view to a more useful picture. 
Exhibits Produced. 
24. I produced a five page document of still images of Male 4 which I introduce as exhibit 19156V_PSNI/MJB/4A. I compared the clothing ensemble of Male 4 as follows. 
Appearance & Clothing 
Headwear 
a) 
In Russells Shops on the 25th January 201m9, Male 4 is wearing a dark beanie/woolly hat. At the same shop on the 27th January he is wearing a dark baseball cap. 

b) 
In the bus shelter footage, Man A has a hooded garment with the hood up. 



Face covering 
c) On the 25th January in Russells Shops, Male 4 is wearing a dark scarf or snood around his neck. On the 27th January in Russells Shops, Male 4 is wearing a scarf or snood around his neck. This item has a random, camouflage type pattern. In the bus shelter footage, when returning from the area of Cluan Place, Man A has a dark face covering. 

Jacket or Top 
d) On the 25th January in Russells Shops, Male 4 is wearing a blue hooded top that has light markings down the left sleeve and a light brand logo or marking at the right side of the chest. On different cameras this top appears to be grey or a green/grey tone. 




Page8 
191891/_PSNI/MJB/4 
e) On the 27th January inRusse/ls Shops, Male 4 is wearing a dark blue hooded top with a light marking at the left breast. 
In the bus shelter footage, Man A is wearing a light blue hooded top, with a small 
dark mark to the left sleeve. 
Trousers or legwear 
g) 
On the 25th January in Russe/ls Shops, Male 4 is wearing dark blue or black tracksuit bottom style trousers that have an indistinct, broad, full length vertical stripes to the outside. 

h) 
On the 27'h January in Russe/ls Shops, Male 4 is wearing dark blue or black tracksuit bottoms that have broad, light, . length stripes to the outside and a light mark at the left thigh. 

i) 
In the bus shelter footage, Man A is wearing dark tracksuit bottoms with broad, light, . length stripes to the outside. When returning from the area of Cluan Place, there is a very small light mark at the upper left thigh, but given the fish-eye view, this is a tenuous observation. 


Footwear 
j) 
On the 25th January in Russells Shops, Male 4 is wearing predominantly grey training shoes that have a broad, light or white mid-sole, a light area at the laces or instep. There is a light area at the heel. 

k) 
On the 27th January inRusse/ls Shops, Male 4 is wearing predominantly dark grey training shoes with a broad, light mid-sole and a white sole. There are light markings to the outside of the uppers. These are different to the type worn on the 25th January. 

I) 
In the bus shelter footage, Man A is wearing trainers that are predominantly grey in colour, with a light mid-sole, and a light sole. There are light markings to the outside of the uppers.

19189v__PSNI /MJB/4 
25. The key similarities for Male 4 and Man A at the bus shelter are the dark tracksuit bottoms with the . length stripes to the outside (as observed on the 2 7'h January shop footage) and the grey trainers (from the 27th shop footage.) 
Comment on any weapon observed 
26. 
In the bus shelter footage, on the return from the area of Cluan Place, Man A is carrying a bright object in his left hand. From behind, a thin, dark area may be seen. These features are highlighted with red ovals and circles on page 5 of MJB/4A. I have been supplied with two photographic images of an asp style retractable baton, files DSC4126.jpg and DSC4127 .jpg. The CCTV images of the object are blurred, but yellow or gold colouring may be seen. 

CONCLUSIONS 

27. 
The clothing comparison does not identify any irreconcilable differences that would allow me to exclude the PSNI proposition that Male 4 is the same person in the shop on the 27th and in the bus shelter footage. 

28. 
The images lend strong support to the contention that the dark blue or black tracksuit bottoms in the 27th January shop CCTV are the same type of tracksuit bottoms as worn by Man A in the bus shelter footage. 

29. 
The images lend moderate support to the contention that the trainers worn in the shop on the 27th January are the same type as those worn by Man A in the bus shelter footage. 

30. 
The images lend support for the object carried by Man A in the bus shelter footage being the same type of baton as the asp in the photographic images. 


31m. These conclusions reference mass-produced articles of clothing and a baton that typically may be purchase on the internet for �10. This support is for the contention that they are the same colour, type, design and manufacture of article. In the absence 




Page 10 19189V_PSN/ I MJB I 4 
of any visible uniquely-identifying features, the articles worn by the subject cannot be differentiated from any other article of the same design. 
32. I reserve the right to review my conclusions should I be permitted access to additional imagery evidence at a later date.

ACCREDITATION 
33. Diligence International operates a quality management systern that has achieved accreditation to ISO9001 :2015 and a security management system that has achieved accreditation to IS027001 :2013. We embrace the requirements of ISO: 17025 and work in line with them where applicable however as a small specialist provider in a number of forensic disciplines, often provided at legal aid rates, accreditation to ISO: 17025 for each discipline and procedure within that discipline is prohibitively expensive at this time.

Appendix A � Guidance for Evaluating Levels of Support 
This guidance note is endorsed by the Forensic Imagery Analysis Division (FIAD) within the British Association of Human Identification (BAHID). The purpose of the note is to provide broad guidance to lawyers and others seeking to understand the use of Levels of Support, and, in general terms, how any stated conclusion may be justified. The note is non-binding on practitioners and it is the strong opinion of the group that it is the expert's professional duty to evaluate each case independently and draw conclusions based upon this guidance note, their own professional experience and any prevalence statistics or other evidence that is relevant to the case and contained within, or referred to, in their report. 
For each of the levels of support, it is not possible to indicate a specific number of required similarities as the factors of most importance differ from case to case. The levels of support should not be seen as a 'stepped' or mutually exclusive set of categories but rather a continuous spectrum whereby each level blends into the next and no distinct cut-off point can be defined. 
It is important to note that the comparisons undertaken do not require satisfying each of the criteria for each level of support. For example, in the case of 'Powerful Support' the images may be of very good quality, with a high level of observable detail but an assessment of relative geometry may not necessarily have been undertaken. 
It is also important to note that the Levels of Support can be used in order to express the weight of imagery evidence that two persons imaged are not one and the same. For example, it may be that differences can be seen between imagery of an unknown person and the suspect/defendant. These differences might not be sufficient to justify the elimination of the suspect, but may raise such concern that a conclusion of moderate 
� support that the two persons are not one and the same is appropriate. 
This note is not definitive. It has been prepared to provide guidance on conclusions in cases of facial comparisons, although the Levels of Support are also widely used in other types of comparative interpretation. The following factors are taken into account when defining each level of the scale: 
� 
The image quality 

� 
The number of facial feature similarities/differences observed 

� 
The number of different times the similarities/differences can be observed, 

� 
Whether or not a comparison of relative geometry can be made, and the closeness of any correlation or difference 

� 
The number of different viewpoints available 

� 
Individual significance attributed to a distinct correlation or difference of a given feature, or several features in combination 

� 
The presence/absence of marks, scars and blemishes

No support 
� 
The imagery is too poor to permit a sufficiently robust comparison from which to form an expert opinion. 

� 
There is sufficient detail from which to form an expert opinion, but the results are such that the similarities are countered by differences, making the imagery evidence uncertain and inconclusive. 

� 
There may be very general characteristics observable (i.e. race, gender, hair colour), but these features do not offer enough support towards specific identity, for an expert to make a more meaningful comparison than a lay person. It would be unsafe to offer any support towards the contention that the two persons under comparison are one and the same using facial image comparison methodology. 


Limited support 
� 
The image quality does not allow for the detail of features to be seen. 

� 
The imagery allows for detail to be seen, but obscuration (hood, hat, scarf etc.) prevents a comprehensive comparison. 

� 
There are a few general characteristics observable, these would include descriptors such as broad nose, moderately protrusive ears etc. Individually or in combination, these features only allow for a 'superficial' comparison. The ability to discriminate between two people of similar general appearance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry* may or may not have been compared, but observation of identifiable landmarks is severely restricted by image quality, 

� 
Only one or two adequate images may be available for comparison. 


* An assessment of relative facial geometry requires that images of the crime perpetrator and the suspect are selected from the same viewpoints and scaled to be the same size. Alignment of the various landmarks (usually facial feature locations) observable, in each of the images, may reveal differences in the facial proport'1ons or the sizes of the facial features between the two items of comparison. A comparison of facial geometry in this way is an assessment of the relative size, shape and position of the various facial features. Differences are more likely to be evident when the images are aligned on both horizontal and vertical axes rather than on one axis alone.

Moderate support 
� The image quality permits a moderate amount of facial feature detail to be discerned: 
i.e. visible features can be described; for example, the nose could be classified as having a narrow bridge and a straight ridge. 
� 
There are a few general facial features that can be compared. 

� 
Individually or in combination, the available imagery allows for a reasonably robust comparison. The ability to discriminate between two people of similar appearance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry may be matching, but the ability to precisely locate landmarks is restricted and rnay therefore be somewhat imprecise. 

� 
The comparison may be limited in terms of the number of images available. 


Support 
� 
The image quality permits individual features to be compared in detail and a confident interpretation and comparison can be made. 

� 
There are some facial features that can be compared in detail. It is likely that the facial similarities/differences will be evident on multiple images. However, they may also be observed on only one occasion depending on image quality. The similarities may or may not be observed in combination. 

� 
Individually or in combination, the available imagery allows for a robust comparison. It should be possible to make a distinction between two people of broadly similar appearance. However, the ability to discriminate between two people bearing a close resemblance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry may be matching, but the ability to precisely locate landmarks is restricted and may therefore be somewhat imprecise. An assessment of geometry is likely to be limited to one or two instances i.e. from one or two differing viewpoints.

Unless ciearly justified by other aspects of the comparison, the assessment of (relative) facial geometry should be very robust, based on several landmarks that can be located with great confidence. A confident assessment of geometry is likely to be available from multiple viewpoints [notwithstanding comparisons based on high quality photography such as passports].

INTRODUCTION 
1. I am a Senior Forensic Investigator at Diligence International, a group specialising in forensic video, imagery, audio, computers, mobile devices, questioned documents and cell site analysis. I am a founder member of the Forensic Imagery Analysis Group (now FIAD). I am listed in the UK Register of Expert Witnesses and was registered in Imaging with the CRFP. 
I hold a Bachelor of Science Degree, a BTEC HNC and ONC in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I am a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering & Technology. I served in the Royal Navy for 25 years, undertaking a broad spectrum of Electronic Engineering work. The culmination of my naval career was as the Weapons Engineer 
Officer of a Nuclear Submarine. 
3. 
From 1999 to June 2008 I was employed by Control Risks Forensics as the senior video consultant, before establishing my own consultancy, Infra Tech Forensics. From April to December 2019 I was employed by BAE Systems before returning to the forensic profession. I specialise in providing expertise in the enhancement and authentication of video material and image analysis. I have successfully completed the Police Air Reconnaissance Imagery Analysis Course at the Joint School of Photographic Interpretation. 

4. 
Shortly after the 7 /7 London Bombings, I carried out the processing of Police & Security Services surveillance video material in support of the Court Presentation of OPERATION CREVICE (R v Omar Khyam & others.) I have provided expertise and support pertaining to the analysis, enhancement and authentication of video and audio material, image analysis and comparison of faces, clothing, vehicles and firearms. In addition I have carried out compilation editing, subject tracking, dynamic event analysis, person height analysis, object identification and video reconstructions. I have applied these skills in many criminal and some civil cases, for both the prosecution and defence. I have given evidence in the Royal Courts of Justice, the Central Criminal Court, the High Court of the Justiciary, Crown, Magistrates and Coroner's Courts. I have lectured to police detective sergeant training courses.

INSTRUCTION 
5. 
This report is produced in continuation of earlier discussions with PSNI by my former colleague Matthew James Stephens (MJS) who has moved on in his career. 

6. 
In summary, the CCTV recordings show suspects who are believed to be involved in the murder of Ian Ogle. The footage has been separated and collated into different folders according to the locations and dates of the recordings. 


7. 
Using subject identifiers (supplied by PSNI), Diligence has been instructed to compare subjects' clothing from CCTV video footage. For Male 5 these are folders 8, 1e0 and 12. I was also to compare the jacket observed in folder 1 footage with a recovered item JD1e. 

8. 
To maintain the avoidance of contextual bias, I have only received the minimum amount of information required to complete the instructions. PSNI assigned person/subject identifiers rather than proving suspect names. I have allocated letters to the male subjects recorded by the bus shelter camera in Albertbridge Road. The subject of interest in this group being Man C. 


Although Diligence has received instructions from PSNI, this report is prepared for Court purposes if required. 
1O. I confirm that I have read and understand my duties in relation to the requirements of Part 1e9 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015 and a signed declaration to that effect is appended to this report. 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGeS 
11e. The clothing comparison is limited to the hooded top with the dark stripes at the sleeve and the light or white coloured face covering. There are no irreconcilable differences that would allow me to exclude the PSNI proposition that Male 5 is the same person throughout. 
DILIGENCE 
Pages 
19189v_PSNI /MJB/5 
12. 
Man C in the bus shelter footage is carrying an object in his left hand and this cannot be excluded from being a kitchen knife. 

13. 
The images lend strong support to the contention that the jacket worn by Male 5 in the Connswater Shopping Centre is the same type of hooded top as exhibit JD1. 

COMMENT 

14. 
For Male 5, there are two distinct tasks in this image analysis procedure; the Connswater Shopping Centre images for comparison with the blue jacket JD1 and then footage from Frome Street with the bus shelter footage near the locus of the incident. 


Levels of Support 
15. The conclusions will normally be expressed using terminology endorsed by the Forensic Image Analysis Division (FIAD) detailed in Appendix A, as either: 
A statement that, on the basis of irreconcilable differences, the two (2) subjects or objects being compared are not the same and are therefore EXCLUDED from further contention. 
b. A statement of the degree of support the analysis lends for the contention that the two (2) subjects or objects are the same, as outlined below: 
Lends NO SUPPORT Lends LIMITED SUPPORT Lends MODERATE SUPPORT Lends SUPPORT Lends STRONG SUPPORT Lends POWERFUL SUPPORT 
c. This scale of conclusion was devised by FIAD in response to requests from the Judiciary for standardisation of experts' opinions in Imagery Analysis evidence. Earlier concluding evidence had been known to cause confusion. Even where experts agreed on matters, their scales of support or use of terminology appeared to show differences of opinion. 



Page6 
19189V_.PSN!/MJB/5 
16. 
The widely adopted scale provides guidance to our findings with an easily interpreted level; but it should be noted that there are no defined thresholds between levels of the scale and that, in instances where two (2) experts conclude with an adjacent level of support (rather than the same level), there will be much common ground in their findings. 'Polar opposites' between experts' conclusions will imply a degree of disagreement in their findings or interpretation. 

17. 
The absence of statistical analysis in imagery comparison exercises is such that percentages or numerical values cannot be used to express our findings. For example, 'Powerful Support' does not infer a one-hundred percent (100%) match. 

18. 
I reserve the right to vary the terminology when to do so would more accurately express my conclusions. 

19. 
From the CCTV folders I have gathered the video files in a professional grade video editing suite for subsequent analysis using Adobe Premiere Pro. Some of the still images extracted from the motion video have had light enhancement (sharpening, brightness and contrast adjustment) carried out in Adobe Photoshop CC. 

IMAGE ANALYSIS 

20. 
By specifying the intended comparisons, PSNI have put forward a series of propositions that Male 5 is the person recoded throughout. In order to address and ultimately avoid contextual bias, I collated the observable features and compared the findings. Interpretation of the imagery is based on the analysis of all relevant disclosed imagery available to me. 


21e. The images are reproduced in an annex to this report exhibited as MJB/5A and MJB/6A. The background image from Frame Street is a full-screen CCTV view, with inset cropped and resized images for illustrative purposes. 



Page ? 
19189v_PSNIIMJB/5 
22. 
Other than the footage from Folder 1, Connswater Shopping Centre (which is of good quality but marginal detail for the face), the supplied incident video evidence does not lend itself to facial comparison because of the 'limitations of the imagery', such as the video resolution, distance from camera to subject, ambient lighting levels and movement of the subject and motion blur. The clothing comparisons are constrained by the same limitations, but the opportunity to detect clear similarities or significant differences is possible. 

23. 
The Albertbridge Bus Shelter camera provides a fish-eye, downward looking view. Using the player software supplied, I was unable to "warp" the view to a more useful picture. 


Exhibits Produced. 
24. For the day of the incident, I produced a four page document of still images of Male 5 which I introduce as exhibit 19156V _PSNI/MJB/5A. I compared the clothing ensemble of Male 5 as follows. 
Appearance & Clothing 
Headwear 
a) 
In the folder 8 images from Frame Street, Male 5 is wearing a round shaped hat that is a darker tone than the main body of his top clothing. 

b) 
In the bus shelter footage, Man C has is wearing a green toned hooded top with the hood up. 


Face covering 
In the Frame Street footage, Male 5 is wearing a light scarf or face covering that appears quite large. In the bus shelter footage, Man C is wearing a light coloured scarf as a face covering that is quite bulky in appearance. This is highlighted on pages 3 and 4 of MJB/5A with a white arrow. 
DIL I GENCE 
Pages 
19189(/_PSNI/MJB/5 
d) 
In the folder 8 images from Frome Street, Male 5 is wearing a mid-toned, waist length top, with dark vertical stripes down the outside of the left sleeve. This is highlighted on page 2 of MJB/5A with a blue arrow. 

e) 
In the bus shelter footage, Man C is wearing the same style of hooded top that is green, with dark vertical stripes down the outside of the both sleeves. This is highlighted on page 3 of MJB/5A with a blue arrow. 


Trousers or legwear 
In the folder 8 images from Frome Street, Male 5 is wearing nondescript trousers 
that are darker than his top. In the bus shelter footage, Man C is wearing dark trousers, possibly black jeans that have some fading at the front thighs. In the shopping centre footage (MJB/6A page 2) Male 5 is also wearing dark trousers, possibly jeans, with fading at the front. All jeans fade with age at the thighs and calves, but this is a general similarity and there is nothing distinctive to give a robust comparison. 
Footwear 
g) In the folder 8 images from Frome Street, Male 5 is wearing nondescript footwear that is lighter than his trousers. In the bus shelter footage, Man C is wearing trainers that are predominantly grey in colour. 
25. The key similarities for Male 5 and Man C at the bus shelter are the green hooded top with the dark stripes at the sleeve {blue arrows) and the light or white coloured face covering (white arrows.) 
Comment on any weapon observed 
26. In the bus shelter footage, on the return from the area of Cluan Place, Man C is carrying a dark linear object in his left hand. This feature is highlighted with red ovals on page 4 of MJB/5A. I have been supplied with two photographic images of a kitchen style knife, files DSC4129.jpg and DSC4131.jpg. The CCTV images of the

----------�--------------------------.
object are small and no individual features may be seen. But there is nothing that allows me to exclude this object from being a kitchen knife. 

Recovered jacket JD/1 
27. 
CCTV images are reproduced in exhibit MJB/6A. The images from Folder 1, Connswater Shopping Centre, show Male 5 wearing a blue Parka style coat. This has a brown toned fur edge to the hood, patch flap pockets to the left and right breast. There is a light area to the left sleeve and the rear view of the hood shows a strap hanging down. 

28. 
Photographs of the jacket JD/1 show a detached brown furry piece, patch pockets at the front and a white logo at the upper left sleeve that I have highlighted in green. The hood has a strap at the back. 


CONCLUSIONS 
29. 
The clothing comparison does not identify any irreconcilable differences that would allow me to exclude the PSNI proposition that Male 5 is the same person throughout. 

30. 
The images lend support to the contention that the top clothing worn by Male 5 in Frome Street is the same type of hooded top as worn by Man C in the bus shelter footage.

The images lend powerful support to the contention that Man C in the bus shelter footage is carrying an object in his left hand; this item cannot be excluded from being a kitchen knife. 

35. 
The images lend strong support to the contention that the jacket worn by Male 5 in 


the Connswater Shopping Centre is the same type of hooded top as exhibit JD1e. 
36. These conclusions reference mass-produced articles of clothing. This support is for the contention that they are the same colour, type, design and manufacture of article. In the absence of any visible uniquely-identifying features, the articles worn by the subject cannot be differentiated from any other article of the same design

38. Diligence International operates a quality management system that has achieved accreditation to ISO9001 :2015 and a security management system that has achieved accreditation to ISO27001 :2013. We embrace the requirements of ISO:1m7025 and work in line with them where applicable however as a small specialist provider in a number of forensic disciplines, often provided at legal aid rates, accreditation to ISO: 17025 for each discipline and procedure within that discipline is prohibitively expensive at this time.

Appendix A -Guidance for Evaluating Levels of Support 
This guidance note is endorsed by the Forensic Imagery Analysis Division (FIAD) within the British Association of Human Identification (BAHID). The purpose of the note is to provide broad guidance to lawyers and others seeking to understand the use of Levels of Support, and, in general terms, how any stated conclusion may be justified. The note is non-binding on practitioners and it is the strong opinion of the group that it is the expert's professional duty to evaluate each case independently and draw conclusions based upon this guidance note, their own professional experience and any prevalence statistics or other evidence that is relevant to the case and contained within, or referred to, in their report. 
For each of the levels of support, it is not possible to indicate a specific number of required similarities as the factors of most importance differ from case to case. The levels of support should not be seen as a 'stepped' or mutually exclusive set of categories but rather a continuous spectrum whereby each level blends into the next and no distinct cut-off point can be defined. 
It is important to note that the comparisons undertaken do not require satisfying each of the criteria for each level of support. For example, in the case ofe' Powerful Support' the images may be of very good quality, with a high level of observable detail but an assessment of relative geometry may not necessarily have been undertaken. 
It is also important to note that the Levels of Support can be used in order to express the weight of imagery evidence that two persons imaged are not one and the same. For example, it may be that differences can be seen between imagery of an unknown person and the suspect/defendant. These differences might not be sufficient to justify the elimination of the suspect, but may raise such concern that a conclusion of moderate support that the two persons are not one and the same is appropriate. 
This note is not definitive. It has been prepared to provide guidance on conclusions in cases of facial comparisons, although the Levels of Support are also widely used in other types of comparative interpretation. The following factors are taken into account when defining each level of the scale: 
� 
The image quality 

� 
The number of facial feature similarities/differences observed 

� 
The number of different times the similarities/differences can be observed, 

� 
Whether or not a comparison of relative geometry can be made, and the closeness of any correlation or difference 

� 
The number of different viewpoints available 

� 
Individual significance attributed to a distinct correlation or difference of a given feature, or several features in combination 

� 
The presence/absence of marks, scars and blemishes 






tZ\S

No support 
� 
The imagery is too poor to permit a sufficiently robust comparison from which to form an expert opinion. 

� 
There is sufficient detail from which to form an expert opinion, but the results are such that the similarities are countered by differences, making the imagery evidence uncertain and inconclusive. 

� 
There may be very general characteristics observable (i.e. race, gender, hair colour), but these features do not offer enough support towards specific identity, for an expertto make a more meaningful comparison than a lay person. It would be unsafe to offer any support towards the contention that the two persons under comparison are one and the same using facial image comparison methodology. 


Limited support 
� 
The image quality does not allow for the detail of features to be seen. 

� 
The imagery allows for detail to be seen, but obscuration (hood, hat, scarf etc.) prevents a comprehensive comparison. 

� 
There are a few general characteristics observable, these would include descriptors such as broad nose, moderately protrusive ears etc. Individually or in combination, these features only allow for a 'superficial' comparison. The ability to discriminate between two people of similar general appearance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry* may or may not have been compared, but observation of identifiable landmarks is severely restricted by image quality. 

� 
Only one or two adequate images may be available for comparison. 


* An assessment of relative facial geometry requires that images of the crime perpetrator and the suspect are selected from the sameviewpoints and scaled to be the same size. Alignment of the various landmarks (usually facial feature locations) observable, in each of the images, may reveal differences in the facial proportions or the sizes of the facial features between the two items of comparison. A comparison of facial geometry in th'1s way is an assessment of the relative size, shape and position of the various facial features. Differences are more likely to be evident when the images are aligned on both horizontal and vertical axes rather than on one axis alone.

Moderate support 
� The image quality permits a moderate amount of facial feature detail to be discerned: 
i.e. visible features can be described; for example, the nose could be classified as having a narrow bridge and a straight ridge. 
� 
There are a few general facial features that can be compared. 

� 
Individually or in combination, the available imagery allows for a reasonably robust comparison. The ability to discriminate between two people of similar appearance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry may be matching, but the ability to precisely locate landmarks is restricted and may therefore be somewhat imprecise. 

� 
The comparison may be limited in terms of the number of images available. 


Support 
� 
The image quality permits individual features to be compared in detail and a confident interpretation and comparison can be made. 

� 
There are some facial features that can be compared in detail. It is likely that the facial similarities/differences will be evident on multiple images. However, they may also be observed on only one occasion depending on image quality. The similarities may or may not be observed in combination. 

� 
Individually or in combination, the available imagery allows for a robust comparison. It should be possible to make a distinction between two people of broadly similar appearance. However, the ability to discriminate between two people bearing a close resemblance is restricted. 

� 
The (relative) facial geometry may be matching, but the ability to precisely locate landmarks is restricted and may therefore be somewhat imprecise. An assessment of geometry is likely to be limited to one or two instances i.e. from one or two differing viewpoints. 

� 
The comparison would usually be based on multiple images to provide consistency and confidence of interpretation.

� 
A lesser strength of comparison may be augmented by similarities/differences in the location and size of tattoos, marks and scars, although fine detail of these features cannot be determined with confidence. 


Powerful support 
� 
The image quality permits a range of features to be compared in significant detail and an extremely confident interpretation and comparison can be made,

A significant number of facial features can be compared in detail. It is likely that these facial similarities/differences will be evident on multiple images, However, they may also be observed on only one occasion depending on image quality.

� 
Individually or in combination, the available imagery allows for a robust comparison. It should be possible to make a distinction between two people of very similar appearance, Two people would have to bear a striking resemblance in order for discrimination not to be possible. 

� 
Unless clearly justified by other aspects of the comparison, the assessment of (relative)facial geometry should be very robust, based on several landmarks that can be located with great confidence, A confident assessment of geometry is likely to be available from multiple viewpoints [notwithstanding comparisons based on high quality photography such as passports].

And also present today is 
SOLICITOR Andrew Russell, solicitor. 
OK ahm Reece obviously you were arrested earlier on today and that ah was in relation to the murder of Ian Ogle which occurred on Sunday the 2?1h of January 2019 ahm I'm going tocaution you for that offence in that -You do not have to say anything but I must caution you that if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court it may harm your defence but if you do say anything it may be given in evidence. Do you understand that? 
KIRKWOOD No comment. 
OK basically Reece all it means is that you don't have to speak to me in this interview but should this matter say maybe a lot of months down the line end up going to a court and you bring up something in court that you could have quite easily told metoday it'll be up to the judge, jury and the court what weight they put on that new evidence cause obviously you've had all that time to think about it. OK ahm I have another wee spiel here to read out just before we ah continue the interview so it says we are now going to ask you some questions about crime. No one should ever admit to something they haven't done or plead guilty to an offence they haven't committed. If you are brought to court for this crime then you can plead not guilty or you can plead guilty. If you plead guilty when you are brought to a court one of the things the court will look at when passing a sentence is the time when you accepted your guilt. The court will give credit to people who plead guilty at the earliest

To be honest Reece you know the this is it's this is only the beginning of this part of the enquiry for you it's a huge enquirythere's a lot of people police officers out doing a lot of things and I appreciate that you have given ahm a brief account of what ahm you have done and that's what what we want to know and that's part of our process is to give you this opportunity to tell us exactly what has happened and I appreciate that you've said that you're in the house all night but if we as our enquiries go on and say the like of CCTV, DNA and all of that is that going to match up if we find you on CCTV how are you going to explain then that you're telling us that you were in the house all night?

attack on Ian. No comment. You just don't seem to be helping yourself Reece, why won't you 
help yourself by helping police to prove what you're telling us. No comment. I did say as well is that my client has a number of medical 
conditions and would normally have had his medication by now 
and I just think that that's maybe something that's relevant to his 
mood as well. 
Do you need to suspend the interview to get your medication. 
No, no but the only thing is, is that we were told the interview
would last 1O or 1o5 minutes, we said that's fine if he could be seenby the nurse and I'm not saying, I'm just making.Yeah. The point. Yeah cause obviously. At this stage. If you raise a welfare issue we have a duty of care to Reece. Yeah well I, well I, I yeah but I'd, I'd, I'd raised it before the
interview and we would said that we'd be happy to take part in the
interview, you'd said ii would only last 1 O or 15 minutes and emm. 
And sometimes these things go. 
So just. 
A wee bit longer. 
No I know but I'm, I'm just saying is that if it is going to stretch that,

And that was recorded on the 30th of the 1 '19. 
I thought I was dyslexic. 
Sorry. 
I said I thought I was dyslexic. 
Well it's some someone else's writing. 
Emmohmm. 
Okay so I'm going to read this to you. It says I am the mother of Reece Jackie Paul Kirkwood, date of birth 24th of the 5th '97. I live at 11 Tower Court, Belfast. I see Reece most days during the day and he would stay over a number of nights during the week. When Reece stays over at my house he sleeps in the front downstairs living eh living room because it, do you want to say something.
No. 
Because it has ah the largest television for Netflix and stuff. Hewould sleep on the sofa in that room and he stays over or sorry when he stays over. On Sunday the 2?'h of January 2019, Reece was at my home. I believe he had stayed over on Saturday night and remained all day Sunday too. Did you stay over on Saturday night.
No comment. 
Cause obviously she says that or you say that you arrive at four thirty on Sunday. 
No comment. 
So that's, that's just I want to clarify if you stayed on Saturdaynight then you wouldn't have arrived at four thirty on Sunday. 
No comment. 
If you were there all day. 
No comment. 
She says I can't be exact with times but we had a Chinese for dinner. My daughter Morgan Kirkwood bought it and bought it, brought it to my house. Reece was present throughout and we all sat and ate at the same time. Is that correct.

No comment. I generally live in the front upstairs bedroom of the property and would be up and down the stairs all the time on the Sunday too. can say that Reece was here all day Sunday, although you would 
say you arrived at four thirty but she would say that you were there all day. Well I was also ah as Andy said earlier, I take a lot of medication 
so. So what are you telling me. I'm telling you nothing, I'm saying I take, I take a lot of medication 
but carry on. That's fair enough you take medication. Are you saying that, what 
are you telling me about the medication, what are you saying about that. No comment. We asked you if that did affect your memory in any way. No comment. Does it affect your memory. No comment. Go and take them sure and find out. No comment. And well every person will, reacts differently to medication so this 
is just, is it, is it possibly some, some elements of your statement. Look I'm tired can we get this please. Is there possibly some elements of your statement are inaccurate 
because you can't remember clearly. No comment. Or is it because it's not true. No comment. So she says he was here all day Sunday which as I say is a
discrepancy with your account emm 2?1h of January 2019 eh and he did not go out. Eh I do not know for sure if he stayed overnight though, I can't be sure. So obviously you've said you did stay over, your mum can't verify that.

So she can't stay,say that you stayed over, you say you did so did you leave thehouse.

Yeah.

So she says to clarify the Chinese was delivered to emm, I thinkthat's my house but Morgan paid. I think Morgan stayed overnighttoo on Sunday eh 2?1h of January 2019. Morgan would stop or sorry sleep in an upstairs bedroom when she stays over. So that, that sorry that's the only the statement emm Reece that we have at the minute. Emm just to point out that obviously thediscrepancy is you say you arrive at four thirty, mum says youwere there all day emm so what account is right.

Ogle.

You know.  
SOLICITOR  But is that, is that just ah is that just a cul-de-sac that you're going down for the sake of asking questions on someone. No.  
SOLICITOR  Like is that, is that actually a reasonable line of enquiry. Yeah.  
SOLICITOR SOLICITOR SOLICITOR  That the police are taking. Well perhaps if, if I say this. I know you can put to Ryan and say well your client's not answering questions maybe he could answer it, but I'm asking you the question, is that a line of enquiry. Yeah well what I'll say to you is that the assault happened on Neill. Emm hmm.  
SOLICITOR  And then a short time later Ian is murdered and we believe that that's the con, there is a connection there. Yeah but you're saying Ryan was involved on the assault on Neill,isn't it, Ryan Johnston was involved on the assault on Neill.

Neill and. Oh to assist on the attack on Neill sorry, sorry. Yes of course. Sorry right. So, so that's what we're asking if, just in relation to background 
were you approached to attack Neill and did you perhaps not, not 
want to be involved in that but then later on subsequently you
were contacted emm. 
Well. 
By Neill or someone else connected to Neill. 
Or by Ryan you know Ryan could have. 
Yeah Ryan has made a statement like. 
Yeah. 
Is, is that a statement, you actually have a statement from Ryan so 
Well 1, I don't have. 
Is that something that he was. 
I don't have that at this stage.

you professionally there but to say I don't have that statement but you're part of a wider investigation. Yes.  
SOLICITOR SOLICITOR  And we're quite a long way into it at this stage even though it's a large investigation I accept that but you would know I supposewhether or not that, that that was whether Ryan had actually said that in his statement I presume at this stage. Well I personally haven't read it. Emm hmm.  
SOLICITOR  Al this stage and that will be something that'll be coming. Yeah.  
SOLICITOR  Later on, emm it's obviously we need to ask questions. Yeah.  
Cause Ryan could quite easily have contacted Reece. We need to know whether Reece knows Ryan you know and could Ryanhave contacted him.  
SOLICITOR  I suppose he could have but then, but ii does come back to like he has made a statement and has he said that.  
SOLICITOR SOLICITOR SOLICITOR  Yes but we need to check the accuracy of everybody's statement. Yeah we can't (inaudible). We can't just take that as red. So this is Reece's opportunity. It seems like a bit of a cul-de-sac that we're going into but. If, if Reece has something to tell us in anything. I, I. Right. It's his opportunity, if he chooses not to answer the question that's absolutely fine emm and as I say that's. Sorry it's, it's just to, to make sure that everything is covered. Emm hmm.

know Ryan through the connection with Ian. No comment. Can, can I just say just on a point there when you say well I 
haven't read the statement and I don't have that information. You're obviously working off though ah like a, a strategy in interviewing you have like a typed out sheet there so I'm not sure how that typed out sheet is devised. 
Oh no this is just. Or is it devised but surely it should be devised on the basis of. Yeah. Maybe what the evidence that is in the possession of police at this 
stage. Yeah what I'd say ..... So I do think it is a reasonable enquiry for me to say is this just a 
cul-de-sac that we're heading to or is it a reasonable line of enquiry.

where the murder emm took place. Do you want to have a wee look at that. No comment. Okay, do you want to have a wee look or are you. 
No comment. Okay. So it shows you onto the Albertbridge Road and then it's believed that the 5 people come then up Templemore Avenue and the car is parked in Langtree Court. Do you want to have a wee look that's not too far away but it's certainly within walkingdistance and if you look at the map here you can see that youwould come from Cluan Place out onto the Albertbridge Road round and then Templemore Avenue and then to Langtree. 
No comment. Is that the route that you'se took. No comment. Cause obviously that's something we'll, we'll be checking CCTV 
eh Reece to, to see if we can identify you or anyone on that. No comment. Was it, who organised the car being in Langtree was that 
Jonathan Brown or Mark Sewell. No comment. Or had you done that. No comment. This whole thing seems to have revolved round, there seems to be 
this incident with Neill and then this murder of Ian. Was it Neill himself that asked you to sort it out.

such a short time. So how was that arranged was that phone calls or was that everyone getting together or how was that. No comment. Cause obviously you know eh you're, you're the youngest one of 
all of these Reece and as I'd said last night is are you like the young guy who tags along and a wannabe if you like. Is that what they see you as. 
No comment. Or is it because you know you do box, do a bit of boxing and stuff, did they think well there's Reece he could do a wee bit of boxing 
and emm we need him beat up so we'll let him do that job, was that your role. No comment. Was that what you were supposed to do. No comment. Did you see anybody with any weapons with them. No comment. Obviously just talking about a bit of boxing and you, you possibly 
hitting him. We have a ring that you wear, emm do you wear that ring all the time.

carried.  
KIRKWOOD  No comment.

other weapons any knives anything like that.

Sorry if you Reece just on that point, if you could just be aware that we have phone numbers for the, the people the names of the other people that are involved which we will also be doing checks on. So it's not only your phone that we'll be checking but it's other people's. So if there's traffic phone traffic on there from their phone going to your number that we believe is attributed to you,well then that, that's also the way of, of connecting you with these people. So again it's another chance to give an explanation of any innocent reason because otherwise if they're phoning you in and around the relevant time it's gonna seem to us that you, you are linked to this incident. 
No comment. 
I suppose it depends as well on the nature of the evidence that you have linking those persons to the incident as well. 
Well. 
It's before you know we, we go on during today Reece just to youknow if we've anything else to show you or tell you it it's better that you just tell us now you know. As I say if it's innocent if it's an innocent explanation it's easier and better to tell us now rather than us come to you and say well what is that or what's that about you know because, you know if you've an innocent explanationjust tell us. 
No comment. 
Or if they asked you to get involved and you simply refused because you're like you maybe didn't want to get in, involved in something so serious, you've nothing against Ian. You made your own decision that that's not something that you were up for, up for doing. If that's the case and you stayed in the house all evening, like you're telling us, then say that. 
No comment. 
Don't be living in fear of these people and let them get away with it while you're the one sitting being questioned about ii. If they're involved and they've done this, point us in their direction, assist the investigation if you have any knowledge whatsoever.

I would say that time as I am always on myphone, I don't have a key to the house and I cannot remember ifthe door was locked or if someone let me in. I heard the TVblasting from the living room. I went in there and saw Reecesleeping on the sofa. He was out cold, snoring away. I went over to the TV and turned the sound down on the set itself. Reece wasstill asleep. I left the living room and closed the door. I rememberbecause it sticks, I went upstairs eh to do tan and see my dogthat lives with my mum. I also sat ah with my mum for a bit in herbedroom too. About 30 minutes later I went downstairs to have acoffee. After making a coffee I went back into the living room to

watch TV as I don't have a TV in my room. Reece was still asleep on the sofa; I put Netflix on and watched an episode and a half of Luther. Reece slept through all the time I was sitting in the living room. He is a very heavy sleeper. I would say I was sitting there for about 40 minutes eh to an hour. After this I went upstairs to the bedroom to do my fake tan. Shortly before 11 pm I next spoke to Reece. I told him I was ordering a Chinese. I told him that Iwas ordering a chicken curry. I know you didn't say emm Reece about the Chinese, did you have a Chinese. 
No comment. 
Did you share a Chinese or have a Chinese with your sister. 
No comment. 
Emm let me see, a chicken curry and if he wanted some rather than ask him emm I phoned the Superior Palace at Bloomfield, Belfast, she gives the number on her phone. Emm her phone shows that that was at 2304. I order chicken curry, rice and chips. I order a portion to share with Reece and my mum, they are a large portion. I would say it took around 30 minutes to bedelivered. The delivery driver said; excuse me, himself that roads were closed off because of something going on in the area. Areyou aware did you hear the driver say any of that. 
No comment. 
I paid for the food. I didn't, sorry I dished out the food, divided it between the three of us, we ate separately and obviously that's different from your mum cause your mum said you'se all eat together. Reece eh in the living room and me and my mum ineach of the bedrooms. Thal was really us for the night. I was on my phorie for a few hours and was up and down the stairs a few times. I can't be exacJ with a time but at one point I went into the living room to turn the TV off. Reece was asleep on the sofa, sometime after 3 am the dog was outside making noise. I tried to ignore it for a bit but eventually I went downstairs. I had to wake up Reece ah as the dog only eh listens to him. Did you bring the dog or do anything with the dog. 
No comment. 
Reece was semi awake eh when he called the dog in. He then went back to sleep in the living room and I went up to mybedroom. That was ah me for bed, for bed. I can't remember, Ican't remember, sorry it's somebody's writing I'm trying to read. Ican't remember the lime.

Can I say something. 
Sorry. 
Yeah. 
It just proves the fact that my sister does not take one bit of medication you know what I mean, so I'd just like-to verify that also, sober minded, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, doesn't do any of that, no reason to lie. Phone record as you say you seen yourself the Chinese 23. Carry on please. 
She says I can't remember eh the time but when I got up the next morning on the Monday Reece was there. I remember this because we had ah no coffee in the house but Reece had small sachets of coffee and give me one of them. On Sunday the 2ylh of January 2019 Reece was wearing shorts I think. I believe this was because I remember seeing his legs. He was also wearing Slider type shoes. Do you normally wear shoes if you're lying on the sofa. 
No comment. 
I cannot remember exactly what on top. I do not know emm if Reece 
has a phone number, the only way I leave messages for him is on his lnstagram. Do you have an lnstagram account. 
No comment. 

And is that how people would normally contact you. 
No comment. 
Can you give us your log in details for lnstagram.

Or how you access it.

Eh which is under his name Reece Kirkwood . I just eh generally see Reece when I see him, he is not really a phone or social media type person. Eh. 
He prefers. 
He prefers Netflix and would chill in front of the TV if he was not at the gym or boxing. Eh when I arrived at 1 1 Tower Court shortly

after 8 pm on Sunday, I could hear the TV emm outside the house; it was so loud I knew it was Reece inside because it was so loud. He listens to the TV eh much louder than, than my mum. So that's obviously eh Morgan's eh statement and Morgan's eh clearly saying that you know she's at the house and you seem to be sleeping totally out of it and there's very little contact you know she turns off eh turns the TV down, turns off the TV. Did you speak to her to emm Morgan at all whenever emm she came into the house. 
No comment. 
Or did you talk to her, I know she'd said about the dog, did you talk to her at the time whenever the dog was barking. 
No comment. 
And what about the early hours of the morning whenever she says that emm you know she came down, did you speak to her at all. 
No comment. 
And did you talk to anybody. 
No comment. 
And I say from Morgan's point of view you're just old cold and that's it. 
No comment. 
So other than the, the meal. 
Ah apart from the meal yes which appears to be sometime around eleven thirty and as I say there is a difference you know you don't mention obviously the meal, mum says you'se all sit together and have this meal but Morgan obviously says you'se all have it separately. It's just to point out that discrepancy in it and then ... 
Sorry can I add. 
Yeah. 
Then just on, you introduced yourself there that eh in your opinion Morgan didn't have, doesn't have any reason to lie and that everything in her statement should be true and I'm not saying it isn't but I just want to suggest the possibility that eh Morgan may have ah a reason to lie and that reason could be to protect you because she knows that you're being interviewed for a very, very

serious offence and that could be a motive for making a falsestatement to police to give an alibi to a suspect in a murder investigation to try and protect that person and if you're a lovedone that is, that's a possibility is all I'm saying to you. Has Morgan told police lies for you. 
No comment. 
No comment. Of the same, of the same people that you're afraid of. No comment. And she knows more about this investigation than she's been 
willing to tell police before. No comment. And the reason that she's giving this version of events is to protect

was around the same age of some of these guys involved. Is he an associate of any of them.

If you destroyed evidence or committed a lesser offence, like anassault, this is the time to say.No comment. And it's fair to say Morgan isn't totally clear on her times you know
she she thinks it was about 8 am and, and things like thatand she's, she thinks maybe she was down watching Luther emmfor 40 minutes to an hour. 
Well she didn't say, she thinks she said. I think she said eh. Yes I, I think I. (Inaudible).I think I was but she she's not clear on her times obviously so that 
can be open to interpretation if she can't actually say you knowshe was there but it is what it is and she's, she's saying that you'rethere, you're fast asleep and you yourself would say that you werefast asleep so I think that's, that's where she's at, at that. Emmand you know you would say there was no activity, nothinghappened and she's basically saying that as well. Did you'se have any discussion eh Reece in relation what Morgan should say topolice should she ever be asked.

Will you confirm that that is your mobile number. No comment.  
KIRKWOOD  Okay. So that is a top-up phone so it is and it has shown that emm there was a top-up history on that done two days before the murder on the 25th of the 1st 201o9. Was it you that topped up that phone.No comment.  
KIRKWOOD  Cause obviously we're going to know where the top-up was done and we can check CCTV, so we're going to see you going to top it up.No comment.

KIRKWOOD  Okay so emm what weve got is emm some outgoing calls really from ah from your phone Reece and it might be important if you pay attention to this. So what we have emm at the minute downloaded is from 2034 hours, so that's emm just after half past eight in the evening and it would show emm continual use of your phone so it does. Do you want to have a look. No comment.  
As you can see right down between eh 2034 and 2109 on the first page there is continual phone calls. So you weren't sleeping thewhole time that was a lie.

and you are now on the phone to someone who may or may not be connected to what happens after that. No comment. And we appreciate this is outgoing but as the day goes on then 
and we are obviously working on all of this but this is where we are at this stage. So were you very keen to tell Walter Irvine about what has gone on.

No comment. Do you want to tell me why. No comment. Unless you can tell us differently and it wasn't you using the phone 
and someone else in the household was using it. No comment. But at this point in time we believe this phone belongs to you and it 
was taken from the house at the time of the search. No comment. And you haven't give us any other alternative to believe it was 
anybody else was making these calls. No comment. Where does your phone normally stay, would it be on you. No comment. Because Leanne's right if it's not you doing it you need to tell us 
who was cause at this time all we can assume is that it's you that's making them. 
No comment. Okay so we'll move on then, emm we're moving on between21o12 hours and 2307.

SOLICITOR Does that call connect does it. Eh no that call doesn't connect either. So between that call andyour next call there's nothing which as I say we've had continual calls right up to then. So between 2117 and 2132 when the murder's happening, you make no phone calls and that's during the time of the murder. KIRKWOOD No comment. Why's that. KIRKWOOD No comment. Is the reason why there's no phone calls is that's you going with the rest of the boys down to commit the murder. KIRKWOOD No comment. Because you can see that's very strange your calls, calls, calls, calls I'll show you all afterwards except within that 15 minutes when this murder's happening there's nothing cause you wouldn't have had time. KIRKWOOD No comment. Cause you were murdering. KIRKWOOD No comment.

No comment.o� Straight after the murder, maybe to tell her what has gone on cause it's maybe went.a bit-further than you thought and then once you get home still panicking again, think who am I going to go to cause as you said yourself know your mum's statement wasn't great and didn't really help you and you said about her medication.Are you more likely to go to granny rather than your mum. 
No comment. And wouldn't, would your granny help you out. No comment. Was that what you were asking her. No comment. So then at 2306 again Ryan Auld, 10 seconds and at 2307 you are 
on the move again at Ballymacarrett, so you seemed to have

You then are obviously there for a while because emm there's no phone calls then until you ring Katelyn Deadman at ah six minutes past one in the morning and you're towards Mountpottinger again, so you've obviously been heading towards home again at that stage or at home. 
What was that call sorry. 
And that only lasts 3 seconds and then at 10, 1.06 you ring Katelyn again and connect for 4 seconds. Why are you ringing Katelyn.
No comment. 
Anything (inaudible). 
Was that the Mountpottinger mast as well was it. 
Eh sorry emm yes. 
It just it clearly shows that there's a lot of activity on your phone and you've told us you've been sleeping, not only is there activity there is movement of your phone and therefore we can onlyassume cause you're not telling us any different, that themovement of the phone means movement of you. So you're out and about, you're out and about at the relevant time, you're at, in and around the scene of the murder at the relevant time, there's you've, you're subsequently at the scene where the car is found in Pitt Place, where your phone is certainly bouncing off that mast anyway. Emm and then you return to your home area and you're back to the Mountpottinger mast and then you, you're back, then you move to onto the Central mast which is near the scene, there's a lot of movement there.

All of these people that you're speaking to or trying to make contact with.

Did one of them ask you to go and move evidence or destroy evidence to assist them in getting away with this. 
No comment. 
Is this what it's about Reece that you weren't actually involved in it but you are like the guy that's going to go and get rid of everything that you, they've told you to go to the car, you know maybe move the car, maybe get rid of anything that's in the car, take it somewhere in particular. Is it a case that you're just like the fall guy to do all of that and the actual main people who have committed the murder are still out there and you're sitting here answering questions for it. Is it, it, are you a minor part in this, if that's the case tell us. 
No comment. 
Because obviously what you have told us about this whole sleeping all night and your sister saying that you're sleeping and your mum's not too sure what's going on, that obviously isn't right because your phone record and this is you making phone calls this isn't even calls corning into you, the activity's continual. So all of that's not true so.

So what, what has gone on, tell us the truth of it. 
No comment. 
You know cause you're the only one that's there and I understand you know if there's-eh people that you're frightened of or people who are making you do things you know that, that can be scary and you don't want to say anything but it's within your interest cause you're sitting here answering questions about the rnurdeL It's within your interest to tell us. 
No comment. 
And just emphasise the fact that yes it is continual except for the 15 minute period when the murder is actually taking place. Youhaven't tried to contact anybody in that time. Now it's for you to tell us were you just watching what was going on.

KIRKWOOD  No comment.  
Or were you, were you off getting the car, were you parking the car, were you elsewhere. Were you busy doing something else altogether, at this point it's a really big void for us that you cannot be traced after all the movement of, of the bouncing off the different masts there's no movement of you or no emm location for � you at the time when this is happening which can only led us to believe that you're involved in this.  
KIRKWOOD  No comment.  
Can you explain it at all the gap.  
KIRKWOOD  No comment.  
You know 15 minutes is quite a while. So either it's dur, the 15 minutes is while the, you're committing the murder or else you're waiting for the others. So what it is.  
KIRKWOOD  No comment.  
Cause all we can assume is that you're involved in the murder, you making calls all night up to that, obviously if you're in the middle of a murder that's going to be more difficult and that doesn't happen planning out to murder and then back and then you start all the calls again.  
And Jonathan Brown being a key suspect in the case whose car is� linked to it, the, the Seat Leon is Jonathan Brown's, it's found outside Jonathan Brown's house in Wolff Close and you're making contact with the.  
KIRKWOOD  No comment.  
Main suspect in the murder investigation.  
SOLICITOR  Well I, I suppose the real part is that we don't know eh I know you're saying just that he's the main suspect in it but we don't know what there is, what the link is between him and the murder  
Well the car's certainly involved.  
Well Reece probably knows.

And that's what we're asking Reece did he know what.

We're trying to obtain that evidence by questioning as well but we have reason to suspect that Jonathan Brown is a key, key figure in this murder. His car's involved, his house involved, he can't be traced, he's gone to ground emm and that only highlights him to us as being involved and you're making contact with him immediately or soon after the murder has actually taken place. Can you see how that looks. 
No comment. 
How would you explain that. 
No comment. 
And that also Reece as I say my concern is you've got your granny by the looks maybe involved in some way cause you're contacting her. Did you try and involve her in some way and you know get your granny to help you either destroy evidence or hide you or whatever cause a couple of times like the first call you make after all of this has happened and you've been on yourphone again is to your granny. 
No comment. 
,
And I know like grannies will look after their grandchildren and is that what you had hoped she would do. 
No comment. 
Cause it obviously needs some explaining. So can you explain any of that, any why you would have told us that you weresleeping the whole time but obviously that's not the case cause your phone is continually and you won't tell us anything else so we're assuming that it's you using this phone and it's in continual use. Can you explain to that why you lied in your pre-prepared statement. 
No comment. 
Because that clearly is a lie.

Emm you know. 
Relevant. 
You know for you eh. So this one says -at about 2030 hours emm parked my car behind a, ah behind a bus stop on the Beersbridge Road. This one really covers the incident involving Neill, eh facing towards the city on the opposite side of the road to Spence's takeaway, to the left is Calvin Street. It was dry and the area was well lit with streetlights. We were sitting chatting in the car when we observed a male eh in a black and white bauble hat, dark coloured zip up sports jacket and dark trousers. He was looking at his phone in front of him. A silver eh Fiesta travelled up the Beersbridge Road and turned in towards Calvin Street where it screeched to a halt. The male front seat passenger exited the vehicle and immediately pro, approached the male on the footpath in the bauble hat. They began viciously punching each other, giving each giving as good as he gets. Emm the person gets out of the red Audi, she was the front seat passenger ah of and shouts at them to stop. Eh she cane't get between them as they are so close. She is screaming at them about how one punch can kill. She sees blood on their faces and the male who got out of the Fiesta has a swollen eye. They grabbed each other by the throat. The older male, 45 approximately, eh about five foot five tall, stocky build, bald and unshaven wearing a Rangers football shirt, gets out of the car and starts punching the male in the bauble hat. He makes a comment that he deserves the beating as he beat my daughter. The fight moves past the Fjesta and further along the . Beersbridge Road. Another car, possibly silver pulls up and an
' 
older 50 plus man and a woman get out. The fight remained on the footpath and the man who had been wearing the bauble hat was getting his head smashed against the wall. The male who had been wearing the bauble hat then ran off towards, up the Beersbridge Road and the two males turned to the Fiesta. Minutes later a muscular male, late 20s, wearing a tight fitting light colour T-shirt appears at the end of Calvin Street. He is talking on a mobile phone and looking around him. This takes approximately seven and a half minutes. Eh drove, it says Claire amm then drove Laura to the rear of her house. The bauble hat which the 
first male had been wearing was left outside Spencee's takeaway. 
� �Shortly after Laura got home, two -women in their �pyjamas, one heavy build wearing a white dressing gown and one of slighter build approached along with the other man at least 60 years, of slight build and wearing a navy jacket, one of them picked it up and sat it down again. A number of people have picked it up today and set it on the bollard. It is now gone. So that's just really sets the scene emm at the chip shop ah Reece. Have you any knowledge of, of that incident at the chip shop,

Sorry. (coughs) 
At approximately 9 pm, eh just as he entered Cluan Place he met Ian Ogle, his nickname is Oggie. He's eh he, I stopped, shook his hand and spoke to him, eh just waited and went on to go to the car. He stood chatting at the mouth of the junction of Cluan Place with the Albertbridge Road. We spoke for about a good . 10 minutes or so. He was in an agitated state, not out of control eh sorry eh but I �knew there had been some sort of altercation, including his son or daughter with a local group eh with the UVF. Ian didn't mention them by name but I have always suspected that was the group he was having difficulties with. There has been a number of incidents going back to 2017. Have you any knowledge of that, did you ever know that there was any problems with the 
UVF and Ian.

KIRKWOOD  Eh he sees himself as old school, he disagrees with drugs. He told me, so before he was emm he was. Very anti them. Very anti them, this may have been ah a cause of the fall out. Eh this was the impression I got from him that it may have led to he and his family falling out with them. Have you any knowledge of ah Ian's family falling out with the UVF. No comment.  
KIRKWOOD  He says he was standing out concerned because there had been an incident with either his son or daughter emm this evening about 1 O minutes before we met. I think he was going he was there trying to protect his family. I think he may have said they're on their way. Eh we also spoke about God, Ian wasn't part of our congregation but I have known him for a number of years. Theywere very welcoming to eh their home. I held his hand and we prayed together on the street. Did you see Ian with a pastor. No comment.

No comment. 
I realised something more sinister was happening. They were walking with purpose. As they passed the-red post box about 15 yards from me I thought they looked eh very menacing. As they eh started to move now more towards him he moved towards them. Eh they came into contact together at the pavement on this side of Cluan Place. The pavement eh nearer to our building or to a building. I can only describe the men as wearing ah dark scarves, well up their faces eh between their hoods up coveringtheir faces and scarves up over eh the bridge of their noses, youcouldn't see their faces. The men eh with, sorry the man with the beard ah looked older. I got the impression he was in-charge.Who would that have been then.

No comment. 
He says I don't know, I don't emm I don't know why I think he was in-charge emm but I do feel that he kept his gaze firmly as what they, as to what they were doing. Initially I thought it was a punishment beating, they were like a pack of hyenas, they laid into him. They were eh spread around him, his arms seemed to be held out to the side to disable his arms. He couldn't protect himself. They were punching and kicking him, his head was down. Is that exactly what happened.

trying to get a response from his dad and was talking to him. There was a pool of blood beside him but not a heavy flow from everywhere. There seemed to be a number of punch, eh puncture wounds. I noticed his eyes half opened and glazed, I thought he was eh gone eh but hoped he was justknocked out. His family were around and were all hysterical, it was a terrible scene, as I didn't see where the gang went at all. I believe they went back in the direction from which they came. So that's obviously a statement from a pastor who was with him at the time and witnessed all of this Reece. Were you part of that gang. 
No comment. 
Were you part of the ones who was punching. 
No comment. 
Did you punch. 
No comment. 
Did you stab him. 
No comment. 
And did you stand on his head or stamp on his head. 
No comment. 
Or who did. 


No comment. 
Can you tell me anything about that. 
No comment. 
Okay. 
Emm just this is obvio�usly this is the first time in the interview process that we have introduced any mention of the, the UVF being involved in it from the pastor's perspective cause that's his understanding of the background to this incident okay so emm we have to consider that as being eh part of the motivation towards that. Emm do you know any members of the UVF in East Belfast.

scene say that they are, would recognise any the persons again, parti.ularly the person that they give the description of. Well this is all we have at the minute emm I can't answer that at

beside him. Is there anything you want to say. Sorry. Or anything you want to tell us about that. No comment. Fur, further to this to the fact that he emm he, Ian Ogle is standing 
with the pastor emm and potentially praying emm in anticipation of a, an assault perhaps, do you have any knowledge of Ian being

whether or not a phone call was received by. No I don't know. Yeah. I don't know but I I'm just surmising that if Ian is standing with the 
pastor there's a possibility that he may have been doing that because he, he feared an imminent attack or you know maybe it was some protection for him for himself emm and if he did have knowledge of that I you know I'm just wondering do you know how he might have come to know that. 
No comment. 
Or do you know why he, he might have expected that people were coming to, to get him that night. No comment. Was the pastor there, does the pastor say that he was there to 
meet Ian Ogle because of a potential imminent attack. I don't think I think it was a. By chance for. It seems. For a. chance encounter. It seems iike a chance meeting I believe yeah it's, just he entered

Okay so obviously murder happens here at Cluan Place okayemm and that's the Albertbridge Road. So we're going to emm we're going here eh in relation to the vehicle which is in Langtree Court and we have a statement from a witness who was close by here okay just across the road basically from, from Langtree Court and this is-their observations. So this is emm so she, they sorry they notice persons at the opposite side of the road and comingfrom Albertbridge direction. So it looks as if emm you've come out of Cluan Place, along Albertbridge Road and then coming into Templemore Avenue from the direction of the Albertbridge Road

okay just so that gives you it visually there. So I noticed persons on the opposite side of the road and coming from the Albert eh bridge direction. The persons when I first seen them were passing the houses next door Keen's shop. I seen that they were wearing balaclavas. Did you have anything over your face. KIRKWOOD No comment. 

Eh they were all appeared to be of average height and were of slim build. The first had a balaclava with two separate holes for the eyes and none of the and sorry one for the mouth. The balaclava was black and dark coloured. The second also wore a balaclava the same as the first. This male had a knife in his left hand. Was that you. 
KIRKWOOD No comment. 
Who had the knife. 
KIRKWOOD No comment. 
This man was wearing tracksuit bottoms that appeared emm sorry is wearing tracksuit bottoms. The other two appear to have scarves appear to be lighter in colour. I think they had their hoods up. Sorry, just bear with me a minute. Says a car parked on the right hand side of the road, all 4 doors of the car opened and they piled in. So she's observed or he or she I'm not sure what it is, has observed emm a car and all 4 doors of the car opened and they piled in. All doors closed again and the CcJr drove up ah Langtree Court and turned. I believe this eh Court is a dead end. Do you know Langtree Court at all. 
KIRKWOOD No comment. 
Eh I believe this Court is a dead end. The car came towards emm after turning and stopped at the give-way, did give way emm before turning left onto Templemore Avenue. So it's gone down then into Templemore Avenue and driving down the street eh before taking the second turn on the right. So it comes down 
� Templemore Avenue and then the second on the right which must be.then Martin Street, aye that would be 
the first on .the right's Martin Street. Is that the direction that you'se went.

You know rather than coming straight up Templemore Avenue and then down you'se have done like a wee bit in sort of the smaller streets and then back up. Is that the way it worked.

I think Major Street was also mentioned as a possible route taken by the car emm it's marked on the map there just in case that jogs your memory in any shape or form, it might not have necessarily have been Martin Street. Where you in the car when it turned down Major Street.

And to be honest if you weren't in the car Reece tell us that. 
No comment. 
You know if yo1J've walked off you know if you've been in Cluan Place and didn't get in the car and walked off somewhere cause obviously we know from your phone data that you, you are about because well your phone doesn't have anything obviously for those 15 minutes while this is all taking place but then whenever it comes back on we know that you're, you're certainly then in the area of where Pitt Place is, so you're in the area.

I would say the witness account there emm is quite consistent with the phone data that we've said to you so far in terms of emm the different masts and the areas that they're saying they've seen people in movement, people connected to this incident, coming down this area, amm and it was just to make you aware that what we've given you already you know is bas, basic information about the phone data but we will be able to get evidential data of you know actual cells sites and where, if somebody was standing here at this particular time, which mast it would have bounced off just to prove that down the line. So at the minute we have basic details of your phone and, and which mast its bouncing off but that will, that will become more firmer in time. But at the minute I suppose, yeah I understand what you're saying but I, I suppose when you're saying the phone is not used there's no, you don't have any data to say where the phone is and so there is the assumption then. Well that's what. But that's what. That it is. Yeah.

The first one was somewhere towards his house and then the next time that it's turned on to make the phone call to the granny, it's up here somewhere cause it's. 

Yeah. 
Coming off a different mast, so the 15 minutes while all of this is, seems to be going on from there until here and then it comes off this mast so obviously you're, you're somewhere about here emm because of your phone and Leanne's right you know there's going to be more details in that you know and we'll, that was only your outgoing we need to look at the incoming. 
Yeah. 
And everything else, so it's going to be able to show you probably more accurately where you are and where you have been emm and obviously CCTV for all of this area as well is all going to be checked and looked at and what people are saying so you know if you had been wearing like a scarf or balaclava� and then you'vetaken it off or can we, are we going to be able to see youanywhere, you know walking along the road, after this and youknow are you going to be able to be identified from anywhere.

How would you describe yourself, what sort of a build would yousay you are.

KIRKWOOD No comment. 

Saw the group of'men then get into a black car eh size of a Seat,sort of the size of Seat Ibiza I think that says. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. Emm so, so the first two males continue walking along Templemore Avenue eh towards the Newtownards Road, so the,the first two males then they're, they're walking emm towards the Newtownards Road but I don't know where they went. I would estimate that all the males I saw were aged in their late teens to early twenties. So did you walk rather than get into the car Reece, is that, is that you that's possibly walking off. 
KIRKWOOD No comment. 
That's it. Basically that that's a couple of people who are about the baths who obviously have witnessed eh people getting into the car and two people walking off to emm they see a couple of people walking off. So that that's what I'm asking you, did you get into the car, or did you walk off or what happened with that.

And we explained in the first interview what that emm cautionmeant". Do you need that further explained, okay. So ino� thisinterview emm Reece we're just going to go through somephotographs that we have and emm the first album is marked DT1 and these are really just photographs of the scene and I'm just going to ask you some questions emm I'll just ask you some things about that.

And did you go in there to get into the car. No comment. Eh page 51 as I say again it's just another view of Langtree Court 
and the same with 52. So that's, that's basically the scene. What that's really setting just emm Reece is as you can see that's across the road, Langtree Court's just across the road from the-old swimming baths there. Basically that's just setting the scene, the murder happens in Cluan Place. Emm it's believe then that the murderers have run or walked from Cluan Place towards Templemore Avenue, round to Templemore Avenue, into Langtree Court, in the car, perhaps not everyone's got into the car, it looks like maybe two people have gone off on their own. Did you, is that what you've done. 
No comment. Did you walk away from it. No comment. Or did you get into the car. No comment. Anything (inaudible). So move onto emm next photograph album which is SH1 and

Okay. 
Okay so that's just to, to show you the scene photographs and obviously the vehicle that emm that you were in Reece. So just really as a bit of a summary then of where we are and obviouslywe've done quite a few inter:views with you and it's really just like a wee bit of a summary just to, to show where we are. So initiallywhenever you came in you done a pre-prepared statement and you had said that you were sleeping all night and emm you know your sister and your mum would back you up. I think your words were, speak to my mum and sister and I'll be outa here by ten, or something like that, but obviously we did do that cause in trying to help you with you know your version of events we have spoken to your mum at an early stage and we spoke to your sister as soon as we possibly could as well but the difference in your account and your mum's account was that your mum says that you were emm there all day. Obviously that doesn't seem to be the case because if we're, if you're to be believed you didn't arrive until half past four. So either your mum's not right or you're not right. So that's you know quite a discrepancy in both those accounts, who you thought your mum would have back you up on that. Then come to yoursister, now there's parts of your sister's is probably right you're prob, your sister probably did see you in the house because obviously the phone records show that you seemed to be about the house at certain times and she would say yes that she came in. The difference and in hers is that she says you were sleeping, you were out cold and sleeping. That from the phone record is definitely not the case cause the amount of activity on your phone, which we showed you and went through it all, shows that youabsolutely weren't out cold because you were phoning lots of difference people and it shows too on the phone records obviouslythat you're not just in the house. At the time of the murder, which 
. is probably quite the significant thing is you're ringing loads of people all night and then at the time of the murder within the 15 minutes there's nothing, nothing at all but then whenever you put your phone obviously use your phone again, it shows you nearer to where the car has been abandoned and I think that's all quite significant as well cause you know you're saying you're in the house, you weren't there and that's, that's definitely not the case. 
No comment. 
Obviously you've talked about being a boxer as well. You talked, you told one of the other police officers you were a boxer and this emm guy Ian Ogle has been beaten and you know is that what you have done, have you beaten him, punched him, kicked him

No comment. 
So you're not helping yourself. 
No comment. 
And then the vehicle as well you know we, we have the car too.You know you in emm with your mobile phone appears to bethere. Is it the case that you have walked down towards where the car was cause you knew where it was going to be parked up. Hadthey asked you to get rid of it, is that wfwt t.e case is. 
No comment. 
You know you've been there, you've stabbed and they're like rightReece this is what we're going to do with the car. You get down there, get rid of that car and maybe the items too that are in the car. Were you told to get rid of those as well. 
No comment. 
The, your phone emm I know we've talked a lot about the phonetoday and we'd said to you that you know your phone seems to be topped up and it's you won't confirm that that phone's yours.We're pretty sure that it's yours and one of the reasons that we are

pretty sure is that on the 25th of January there was a top-up done on that phone. Now they have been out to the place where you topped it up and you can see you on CCTV. So from we're, our point of view we're concerned, it seems to be attributed to you, you seem to be the one going to top it up, so I think the phone is definitely yours. So on the night of Sunday night you were obviously at your home, maybe as your sister said for a while and then however whoever's contacted you about Neill or whatever way that's happed, you obviously have gone out. You've went to that murder, you've been to the murder, you stop using yourphone for the significant amount of time. You're then, your phone's showing you to be down at the car and then you ring your granny and I think that's maybe for your granny to help you. So that that's, that's what you've done. It also then shows that later on you appear to be back at the murder scene and is that to pick up something, has somebody dropped something, has somebody left something behind and are you the guy just they leave to clean up the mess. 
No comment. 
You know where you left to just go and collect whatever it is, were you told then to go and get rid of the car, were you just the guy that's left to do it all. 
No comment. 
So really just in summing up did you murder him. 
No comment. 
Did you murder Ian Ogle on Sunday night.

No comment. Cause obviously we've brought in a couple of weapons as well emm we showed you them and I know you'd said there was a handle for a pick axe, it seems a strange thing to have and you
also had in your house a knuckle duster. Are they the sort of things that you would carry with you normally. No comment. Do you normally go out with weapons like that to hurt and beat 
people. No comment. Cause I know during sort of the first interview you, you do seem to 
have a bit of a temper on you. No comment. So anything that you want to say about this. No comment. Anything else. The only point on the phone contact again would be the significant 
contact with another suspect in this case with Jonathan Brown after the incident and you can't give us any account of that and you're not even attempting to provide us with any account for _it. 
Was that, was that, was that the, was that the one se_cond was it the one .... For one second but it's still an attempt to contact. No comment. A suspect in this murder investigation. 
No comment. Which either means you were involved in the murder or you'reprotecting those that were unless you can give me any other kind of innocent explanation.
