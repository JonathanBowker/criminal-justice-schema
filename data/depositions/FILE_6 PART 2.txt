of your life right now. I know this. You know you're, you're in custody for murder, you can't get 
more serious than that. I know. If I could remember I would tell you. You know so we, we need to know what happened after you 
were assaulted in that 45 minutes. Like I, like I'm saying to you I cannot remember, I couldn't even see two feet in front of me there was that much blood on my 
face so whoever, how I got there or whoever or whatever I've done I can't remember a thing. Because you know we will be able to check all these things out. That's. You know if you say you were in someone's house we can 
check. Yeah that's fine. On CCTV to see if where you were, we can check phone calls, 
we can go and speak to people to prove that you were with you know. 
That's fine. So that you weren't at the scene of the murder because at the moment there's nothing to say you weren't there. 
There's nothing to say he was.

OGLE  Yeah.  
Destroyed the clothes because, because of your own blood on them, is that what you're, you were telling me.

Most people would try and wash their clothes before simply throwing them out.

OGLE But let's start with the lies that you've told already. Neil let's begin with statement then of a Lisa Duffield okay. 
Do you know Lisa. 
No response. 
Do you know her. 
No, no comment. 
Okay. Okay I'll read from eh Lisa's statement then. I am the sister-in-law of Ian Ogle, my partner Colin is Ian's brother. I work for the East Belfast Constitutional Club on the Newtownards Road, Belfast. On Sunday the 2ih of January 2019 I started work at eh 12.45 pm. Eh Lisa then goes on basically to say I left work at approximately 7 pm, 1900 hours and I walked round to the Albert bar to meet my mother, Hetti Duffield. The Albert Bar is only around the corner from the Conn Club em so it only took me a couple of minutes. Would you agree with that it's only round the corner. 
Well I don't see why you're asking him to agree. 
I know. 
With somRthinQ thc1t's in c1 stc1tP.mP.nt you'rP. hc1sir,c1lly ,askino him to agree with something so that you can. 
Just that. 
Turn round and say well there you go that, that factor's right. 
It's, it's shortly after 7 pm then okay. Well I would say the Conn Club's only around from the Albert bar. So it's about 7 pm anyway eh to get there. I'm not sure how long we'd been in there when Neil Ogle came in. I do not speak to him following a family fall out but he is a cousin of Ian and Colin's. He came in and spoke to a couple of people, he had a look around the bar, said hello to some people and left again after 2 to 3 minutes. Did you go into the. 
I can't remember. 
You can't remember. Did, do you know the Prince Albert.

Would you frequent the Prince Albert Bar. 
OGLE Would I wha. Would you go into it, drink in it. The Albert. The Albert. 
OGLE I don't really go out drinking. Okay. So again were you here on Sunday. OGLE Like I say I can't remember being in it. You can't remember a lot of things. 
OGLE No. We've asked you about Neil. This is before the assault. 
OGLE I know and like I say I can't remember like, like I said to you I can't remember what wc1v I wc1lk. sorry whc1t wc1y I wc1lk1erl ":' home or nothing. 
Okay. OGLE Cause I take all different routes. But you didn't mention to us when we've asked you and going through it again anything about going into the, the pub. 
SOLICITOR He's indicating he can't remember. Yeah. But it's casting doubt on what you're telling us. Again is there any reason why you can't remember. 
OGLE No no reason whatsoever. Have you anything medically wrong with you that would cause you to not remember, do you suffer from blackouts or anything.

OGLE Hmm not that I know of, no. 
And again we asked you previously to try and assist you about garages, pubs. 
OGLE Yeah. 
Any sort of shops and you neglected to tell us. 
OGLE Yeah. 
SOLICITOR Didn't neglect he says he can't remember. 
OGLE I can't, yeah, that's right I couldn't remember. 
Okay so then Lisa says you left after 2 to 3 minutes and again Lisa's making reference to some sort of family dispute, do you want to tell us about the family fall out. 
OGLE No. 
Okay I'll continue then. I don't remember how long, excuse me, maybe an hour or so later, this is after you've left the Prince Albert eh the door burst open. I was still sitting at the bar and glanced around to see Mark Sewell come in and come straight to me. Do you know Mark Sewell. 
OGLE I know of him, I haven't seen him in years. 
Emm hmm. Is he a friend or. 
OGLE No. 
Em I would Mark Sewell to say hello to for approximately the last 1 O years, we live in a small area and I would see him about the odd time in the Conn Club and the Albert Bar. He came right up to me and shouted, you're fucking getting put out of the country, you and your family. I think he also said something about 24 hours. I asked him what was going on. He said Neil Ogle is lying in a pool of blood and you got him set up or words to that effect. He shouted at me to get out of the bar now and then he stormed back to the door, okay. So this witness is telling us Mark Sewell comes in, he knows about you being assaulted, did you tell Mark Sewell that you were assaulted. 
OGLE I, no.

You haven't seen him in r1 co11ole of years. Aye. Do you know if he lives in the local area. No. So again this is all approximate times but within an hour this 
man, and who is being sought by police in relation to this investigation, but remains outstanding is shouting at Lisa Duffield about you being a, lying in a pool of blood. So somebody had to have told him about you being assaulted and again so who did you tell. 
No one. About you being assaulted. Not one person.

SOLICITOR This is extracts from that. From that statement okay. So in July 2017 eh Ryan was with his friend em also whose also known as Google, do you know Andrew Google. Eh in the Albert Bar on Albertbridge Road which Lisa advised is run by the UVF. There was an altercation between Ryan and a guy in the bar known as Saucy over asking Ryan, sorry over Ryan asking him to move. Do you know a Saucy. 
OGLE I know of him. Okay what's his name. OGLE No comment.

Em later that night Saucy was taking money of people for a lock in, he accused Ryan of giving him dirty looks. Ryan was then attacked by Johnny Brown okay. Johnny Brown and Saucy gave Ryan a real beating and the bar got wrecked. Eh Ryan's sister and father on hearing he was involved in a fight arrived and joined in. Ryan was bottled and required 6 stitches to his head wound, to a head wound sorry. Em and then when you come into it allegedly, Neil Ogle, Ryan's cousin who Lisa claims is UVF. 
(Laughs) 
Was present during the fight but didn't support Ryan which resulted in bad feeling between them. Is that what the fall out between you and Ian was. 
No comment. 
Is this when it dates back to, July 201a7. 
(No response). 
What can you tell us about the, the fall out. 
I don't want to talk about it. 
Do vou remember this fight in the Prinr.R AlhRrl. 
No, no comment. 
Were you present in the Prince Albert at this, on this assault. 
N, no comment. 
Cause we're only interested in it because we suspect this is basically when it all started this feud or fall out. 
Yeah. 
Between yourselves okay which ultimately led to Ryan Johnston getting out of a car and assaulting you and then subsequently Ian Ogle is murdered okay. So this is why, it is quite important to us so any information you have about this historic assault would you care to tell us your side. 
I've told you the two of them got out of the car and assaulted me.

barred for, sorry, got barred for wrecking the bar, did they. No comment. Do you know if they did. Haven't a clue. It's not my bar. They went and saw a top UVF man in Dundonald eh labelled, 
known as Helmet, do you know Helmet. Never heard of him. Okay who reassured Ian that they wouldn't be touched but he 
said they had to pay money or the whole family would be put out. Ian and Vera paid 500 pounds but they were still getting threats. Ryan and his father Ian were ordered to come down for a punishment beating about a year ago, they wanted to break Ian's arms and have him watch Ryan beaten, being beaten up. They refused to go down which the UVF didn't like. Do you have any knowledge about this here.

Em tried to run Ian over outside Keen's furniture shop, Ian told Lisa this. Eh the threats forced Ian to leave his job in a factory in Newtownards and resulting, excuse me, resulted in him rarely leaving the street. Any of that sound familiar to yourself. 
No response. 

That's obviously Lisa who obviously goes out with Ryan but is not a member of the, the family okay this is all information she's been told. She wasn't present there either. Eh moving on to the date in question then eh Sunday the 2ih of January 2019 Lisa, Ryan, Vera and Ian went to Toni em the other daughter or lirn's dai1ohtRr Rm ;,it 4 o'dor.k for rlinnAr.

Gareth Walker, was present as was their 12 year old child. 
Lisa drove everywhere there in her silver Ford Fiesta. Eh and 
they left to go home about 8.30 pm okay. As they drove along the Beersbridge Road Ryan saw Neil, yourself, up ahead walking along the pavement in the same direction they were travelling. Lisa stopped at the set of traffic lights, Ryan whispered to her pointing out Neil em he asked her to let him out so she pulled up in front of a row of shops on the opposite side of the road. This was the same side Neil was walking on. Ryan em went up to Neil as Lisa parked the car and they started fighting. Ian was shouting to be let out of the car which only had 3 doors. He and Vera were in the back. Lisa let him out of the car and he started hitting Neil as well, just a couple of punches. Ryan had Neil by the hair and was saying that his family hadn't helped him that night. Do you remember that being said to you at all. 
No, no.

Where did they stop. They stopped, they were sitting at the, I just seen them like turn as I turned they were just, they were silting there in the car. 
So they pulled over where you were. They ah but the car. Were you walking. Was stopped dead. Em but yes so as I was saying Ryan was saying to yourself 
apparently that his family hadn't helped him that night which is why we would put some emphasis on what happened in July 2017 and this fall out between yourself and Ian. So again is there anything you wish to tell us about that fall out. 
No, no. Eh Lisa would then continue saying Ryan was wearing a green 
eh Northern Ireland football top eh black Under Armour shorts and. This is Ryan. Right.

Ah ha. 
SOLICITOR But you asked him an open question before that which I'd no issue with.

Because he's been assaulted. Yeah well it's just, it's a rhetorical question you know (inaudible}. 
SOLICITOR He, he'd already answered it and then you went further with that. 
Okay. 
Em so this witness then goes on to say, where am I, when Ian, Ryan and Lisa got home they realised Vera had the keys and they had to wait for her to come back. After they arrived Lisa, Emma and Vera went to Toni's eh in Emma's car, a people carrier, to collect Toni and bring her down. On the way back they drove down the Newtownards Road, they turned left onto Templemore Avenue. Lisa desr.ribes seeinf) men. ShA s.w . group of people on the left hand side of the road outside some sort of hall, they were looking across the road. She looked into the same, sorry, she looked in the same direction and saw 5 to 7 men running. Emma pulled into the street on the left opposite Langtry Court, Lime something. Lisa had a clear view and first saw the males half way between Keen's furniture shop, furniture shop and the corner of Langtry Court. One had a hat with a red porn porn, this male was pulling up his top to cover his face. They ran into Langtry Court towards a black Seat Ibiza car, unknown registration, a couple of the men got into this car which was facing inwards. She was distracted by tel, Toni yelling in the back and didn't see where the other males went. The vehicle drove out of Langtry Court, turned left and headed towards the Newtownards Road. They then got a call to say they had got Ian at the top of the street. They drove to Cluan Place where Ryan was holding his daddy who was on the ground. The pastor and Google were there too. Lisa believes he was already dead at this point. She states she would not be able to recognise the men involved again. So

OGLE Ok. 
Ok. 
OGLE Yeah.

time ok I don't know if you were aware of that or not but it has been released in the news ok. 
OGLE Ok. 
So on Sunday the 27th of January 2019 at approximately 9pm ah this Pastor is with Ian ok and describes it ahm being at Cluan Place ok. So just as we enter Cluan Place I met Ian Ogle, his name is Ogi, do you know that as his nickname. 
OGLE Yeah. 
Yeah, do you have a nickname. 
OGLE People call me it. 
You just get the same. 
OGLE Everyone aye. 
Ok well that's it. 
OGLE Most of the family give ii. 
Shortened version of the. 
OGLE Yeah. 
The surname. Ah so the witness continues I stopped, shook his hand and spoke to him ah he, he was walking with another female but she's carried on ok so ahm she just waved and went onto her car. We stood chatting at the mouth of the junction of Cluan Place with the Albertbridge Road. You know where we're talking about ok. 
OGLE Yeah. 
Yeah, ah we spoke for a good 10 minutes or so. He was in an agitated state, not out of control but I knew there had been some sort of altercation in, involving his son or daughter with a local group, with the UVF. Ian didn't mention them by name but I've always ahm suspected that what that was the group he was having difficulties with. There have been a number of incidents going back to 201a7. Ah someone in a car tried to run him over, a number of shouting matches on the streets, Ian was UVF himself but he considered himself old school, he disagreed with drugs he told me. So before he was very anti

them, this may have been a cause of the fall out. This was the impression I got from him that it may have led to and his family falling out with them the UVF. He was standing out concerned ah there had been an incident with either his son and daughter that evening about 10 minutes before we met. We would say that's the assault or the assault on yourself Neil ok. I think he was there trying to protect his family. I think he may have said they're on their way. Were you on your way. 
I wasn't there, I wasn't on my way anywhere. 
Did you send someone on their way. 
No definitely not. 
In relation to the assault on yourself. 
Definitely not, no. 
Ah the witness continues we also spoke about God. Ian wasn't part of our congregation but I've known him for a number of years, ah they were very welcoming to their home. I held his hand and we prayed together on the street. Ah the witness then goes on, I then became aware of a group of about 5 people, they all had their hoods and scarfs up except one who had a partial beard, his face was exposed, he'd short hair, I believe his hair was brown. The beard was oerhaos 5 davs 
stubble. He had sideburns, Templemore Road direction. 5 people.  they Again  were were  coming you one  from of these  the

Do you know any of these 5 pe ople.

OGLE No. 
Of January, have you ever had facial hair, a beard. 
OGLE No I shave every 2 days. 
Ok. 
OGLE This has probably been the longest in a long while. 
Ok. I realised something more sinister was happing, was happening, they were walking with purpose as they passed ah the red post box about 15 yards from me, I thought they looked very menacing as they started to move more rapidly towards him. He moved towards them, they came into contact together at the pavement on this side of Cluan Place ah the pavement nearer to our building, his church he's referring to. I can only describe the men as wearing dark scarfs well up over their faces. Between their hoods up covering their faces and scarfs up over the bridge of their noses you couldn't see their faces. The men, the man with the beard looked older, I got the impression he was in charge. I don't know why I think he was in charge but I did feel that he kept his gaze firmly on what they were doing. Do you know this male this pastor's describing. 
OGLE No. 
Initially I thought ii was a punishment beating, they were like a pack of hyenas, they laid into him. Was it a punishment beating. 
OGLE I don't know, I don't have a clue. 
Is it a punishment beating gone wrong. 
OGLE I don't, haven't a clue about it. 
Ah they laid into them, they were spread around him his arms seem to be held out at to the side to disable his arms he couldn't protect himself. They were punching and kicking him, his head was down. The blows still coming down on him, I said, I saw sorry, I saw a bat of some description it looked like a baseball bat. They were hitting at him at the back and he went down, they continued to attack him and they started to walk away. The smallest one in the grey hoodie stamped on Ian's head as well as kicking him. They stamped on his head 4

to 5 times. Ok so it's quite a brutal assault then it's 5, 5 against one ok. What is your knowledge of this assault. 
Have no knowledge of it whatsoever. 
Is there any knowledge you wish to tell us at this stage. 
No because I don't have any. 
Any involvement in this. 
Nothing at all. 
Assault, or any involvement in the organisation of this assault. 
Nothing at all, I don't, I wasn't there. I wasn't involved at all. 
Ah the witness then continues I said that's enough don't stamp on his head anymore, don't stamp on his head or words to that effect. He then did, sorry he did then stop, he didn't look at me he just walked briskly away after the others. That's the short one he was describing. I didn't notice what direction the attackers went. Ian was groaning a low growl. He wasn't breathing, I thought he was lying as if he was in the recovery position. I worried if his neck was broken having been stamped on. I lay my hand on his belly and prayed. He let out a couple of aroans. His son Rvan arrivP.rl hP. w;cis rlistmssP.d ;cit thP. <siQht of his dad, now Ryan was trying to get a response from his dad and was talking to him. There was a pool of blood beside him but not a heavy flow from anywhere. There seemed to be a number of puncture wounds. I noticed his eyes half open and glazed, I thought he was gone but hoped he was just knocked out. Ah his family were around and were all hysterical ii was a terrible scene as I said I didn't see where the gang went to but I believe they went back in the direction from which they came. Do you have any knowledge of what that witness has described. 
None whatsoever. 
And again where were you at this point. 
At that point I would have been in my friend's house. 
And his name again.

Ok this then is a statement from another witness that's seen the, the, we'll go through it here but it's a few minutes after. 
Uh huh. 
The actual murder, the people running off ok. Ah let me see the time, ahm it was around sorry 9.20pm ok. This witness is on Templemore Avenue ok near the swim centre, do you know where the swim centre is, the swimming baths. 
The baths ah yeah, yeah. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Ok, ahm this witness then describes at 9.20 approximately I noticed persons on the opposite side the road and coming from the Albertbridge direction. The persons, when I first seen them, were passing the houses next to Keen's Shop. You know Keen's. 
Aye furniture shop. 
The furniture shop. 
Yeah it's been there a while. 
I seen that they were wearing balaclavas. They were, they were all appeared to be average height and were of slim build. The first had a balaclava with 2 separate holes for the eyes and none for the mouth. The balaclava was black, stroke dark colour. He had long sleeve, he had a long sleeved top on and that's all I can say. The second also wore a balaclava the same as the first, this man had a knife in his left hand. Are you right or left handed. 
I'm right handed. 
Ok, it goes on to describe one of these males as this male was wearing ah track bottoms that appeared to have cuffs at the bottom, the other 2 wore what appeared to be scarfs. They appeared ah to be lighter in colour not black and I think they had their hoods up. They all ran in a single file and were all wearing trainers and you confirmed to us earlier you were wearing trainers and a tracksuit.
