SOLICITOR  Yeah.  
But as it was no comment. Okay so ahm 2109 hours okay, did that person on the bicycle, or sorry the person on foot come into Wye Street?  
ERVINE  No comment.  
SOLICITOR  Can I ask a question, the ahm, there's no ahm, sorry yes, the, the footage of the person running up, there's no then footage from the other camera?  
No there's not.  
SOLICITOR  And is that because that the level of motion obviously this is something which you might not have the technical knowledge at this point, but is that because the, the, the movement of the person is not sufficient to activate the camera?  
Ah it is possible alun from the way the person was going there on the futiher, you know from the pavement fttt1hest away from the camera so it may not have picked it up for that reason but I'm not ...  
SOLICITOR  Yeah. And if that, if that is the case then if the, if, if the person entering ahm or that you say enters Wye Street at 2021 on the bike  
On foot.  
SOLICITOR  On foot, well .  
Oh no sorry ...  
SOLICITOR  The person on the bike ..h.  
The bike, yes.  
SOLICITOR  That if that person had let\ that address in that, at a time subsequent to that, that the camera may not have picked that up, would that be a case?  
Ah it may not have ahm ...  
SOLICITOR  Well ifit didn't pick up, ifit didn't pick up a person on foot going past it at that point ...  
Ahhha.

SOLICITOR SOLICITOR SOLICITOR SOLlClTOR  Yes. Between 202 l and whatever other footage you have. Ah ha. I know that people have viewed, you know, obviously this footage in particular has been viewed for a couple of hours ... Yeah. And this is the 2 most relevant sightings that we are info1111ed about. Yeah. All I can say is obviously the streets are all interconnected, you know, your address is ah, was Newcastle Street at the time wasn't it Walter? (Inaudible) but my point of it is that if it's a motion activated camera  
SOLICITOR  Ah ha. And if it doesn't pick up, like you're putting it that that persons who's running up is the person who's running towards Wye Street  
SOLICITOR SOLICITOR SOLICITOR SOLICITOR  Ah ha. But there's no footage of him running towards Wye Street. No. So it doesn't actually, so it might be the case that a pedestrian doesn't activate that so you won't know what other, the person you're putting as been asking my client is that you on the bike, if that person had left that address they might have done that but there just wouldn't be any CCTV because the motion censors don't pick that up. Ah yes possibly. Yeah. Ahm but again you know, Wye Street the other end of Wye Street isn't covered so all we can do is based on what is going up. Okayahm but again your client is choosing his no comment .. Yeah.

Okay so this is just ah, this really quick so bear with me all right, so

This is after, just after the footage that we seen of the assault on

So I'll just play here and I'm going to, this is the first male running up we believe to be you in the blue, so do you see there, very, very slightly, I'll try and get it stopped there. Hold on. You can see what 
is believed to be a gold or yellow coloured baton. You can see it in the hand at that stage there. There. You can see, you see it flicker just as you went past there, I can show you it again, I've watched this a number of times, there is, there is a still image ... 
That you can see that it's gold coloured, it's obviously not in that but you can see yourself there it's not silver, you can see, I can take it back again because when you do watch it a couple of times it does become more apparent. 
Which again is why Police believe the 2 items found in the river are 


There's maybe a better one there. There you can see as it's going, 
it's not, you can tell it's not a silver baton anyway, it's definitely a gold coloured, which is why we believe it's (inaudible). 
The 2 items found in the river on the 14th are the same.

Ahm and what we do as a Police investigation or as part of this

case in yours, Walter we do financial checks okay. Ah we are able 
to access your bank accounts with the right documentation and we 
are able to find or asce1iain where you know you've been using 
maybe your bank card or something like that and that allows us 
therefore to get CCTV images for this case or perhaps you know 
topping up phones or anything like that there, okay. Alun so this 
relates to an A TM transaction timed at 12 minutes past 12 in the 
afternoon okay. Obviously we have accessed it and stuff but what

2154 ah Reece Kirkwood rings yourself back in a call lastingl5 seconds okay. So a lot of chat then with Reece Kirkwood okay. Is that somebody we should talk to about your movements that night? 
No comment. 
Ah 2234 Jonny or Jonathan Brown rings yourself and the call lasts 2 seconds okay. Where are you at that point Walter? 
No comment. 
Because we would say from our CCTV enquiries that's in and around the time Jonathan Brown is has left his house in Pit Place and was making his way round to Wye Street okay. So Jonathan Brown is ringing you before the murder of Ian Ogle, 15 minutes before and now he is ringing you just after an hour after the murder. Now that is quite significant, so what's discussed? 
No comment. 
Is he, is he telling you about the murder? 
No comment. 
Or is this about the clean up? 
No comment. 
Because at 2246 your phone is switched off. The phone ending 920 is switched off and never registers again, never makes a registeredphone call. Is that you destroying the phone?

So it's putting you down in this area Walter okay, you've moved from here where we say you are in the Prince Albert, you're down in this area because you are at the murder scene, isn't that right. 
No comment. So1Ty you said that at, so1Ty go on ahead. All right, okay. At 21 ;24:46 and 21 ;24:47 then you were back 
registering Mountpottinger East okay and then that may explain what we were discussing about moving masts or moving to different masts but it puts you in the Lower ah Albertbridge Road area. Isn't that correct Walter?

Yes, okay. But again it's a working opinion that we believe it fits

your movements, your clothing, CCTV, your phone records, it all  
links you to this murder and I believe it's time you, you told us  
more than what that paragraph says.  
ERVINE  No comment.  
Okay. Okay ah Walter you were arrested for the offence of murder  
on the 4th of Febrnary 2019 and you've been interviewed several  
times by Police and again I will remind you it is not, it is your right  
not to answer any of my questions or our questions put to you, but  
as I have already highlighted should this matter go to Court then  
inferences can be drawn if you decide to give an account later in  
relation to any of these matters put to you during this interview  
process okay. Throughout the interview process we have shown  
you ah the following evidence which links you to this murder and  
this is not just a circumstantial evidence okay all these bits come  
together to show how you are involved with it okay. Telephone  
evidence shows that you were in contact with Neil Ogle and  
Jonathan Brown during the period between the assault on Neil Ogle  
and the murder oflan Ogle.  
SOLICITOR  Sony that he's in contact, is that the 2 second phone call?  
Yeah.  
And also there was a 7 second phone call with Brown as well.  
SOLICITOR  But is that, sorry, just, just the issue with Neil Ogle, you know ahm I  
think it's been, I think it's been said in previous interviews, I can't  
remember which one, that the 2 second phone calls are phone calls  
which don't connect.

that's at the time he's meant to be cycling up the street? Yeah. 
Wye Street? 
Ahnha. 
Closer to the Lough, son-y I just got lost there (inaudible). 
I can't comment on, I don't want to comment on where the masts 
are, I don't know. I know but, but the point of it, the point of it is that if you are, if you are going to rely on the DDR in relation to the movement of a phone 
which you say is in my client's possession that it has to, that has to suppott all of your, all of your assettions really. That would put him still in the area of East Belfast. But so does, so Wye, son-y, sOITY just looking at the map, so Wye 
Street is ... 
Where is it, here. 
Is there yeah. 
Yeah. 
Which is, and, and so, and so where is the Victoria Channel mast, 
do we know? I don't know. You don't know. But it must be closer than the Conn Club is what 
you're saying, which is there? 
I don't know. 
But if, but if you're saying there's a connection, you're saying

But if you say, but if, but if you say, when you, when you initially commenced with the DDR, and it was me who actually, who had said to you now are you sure that's correct you said about the nearest mast ... 

Ahnha. 
And so if it is the fact that it connects to the nearest mast then Victoria Channel must be closer to Wye Street than the Conn Club which seems to be just around the comer. 

I don't know. I don't know. I know ... 
But on that theory, all I'm saying is that logically, logically in the manner in which yoti have presented it ... 

Ahha. 
I know you don't know where the mast is and I don't know where the mast is ... 

Ahnha. 
But logically in the way that you have presented it, that it must be closer than the, than the East Belfast Constitutional Club, which I presume are the masts on top of that building. 

I believe so, but .n.. 
Yeah. 
Again, there is, maps will be produced with the relevant masts ahm showing (inaudible) but at this stage this is your time to account for your movements on Sunday the 27th but you have refused. 
Well then just, if that's, if that's as high, if that is as high as you can state it at this point then with respect that I say that is, that is not evidence which can support alun the assertion which you are trying to put to my client for his involvement in murder. 

Ahnha. 
Because if you are not able to, if you are not able to address the issue of where the masts are and whether it may be closer or alun further away than the Conn Club mast at that relevant time ...

Well then maybe the DDR, maybe the DDR, maybe, maybe the, the, the state that the DDR evidence is in at this stage is not, my point is itjust, maps can (inaudible) maybe at this stage of the game of, of, of this stage in the investigation the DDR is not evidence which can be relied on in support of the assertion that you are putting. 
Well it puts him in the area. You're not able to, but, yeah, well .. . And again, that we would remind .. . We're all, well it depends what the area is. Ahnha. It depends how you define the area. Well he's definitely in East Belfast that night. Well there you go, there you go, that's, that's as broad and as 
generic then as we can probably put it at this point. And he is moving about. And again ... East Belfast and moving about. He's been asked several times ... Okay. For his account, but. And we can confirm that he's at the East Belfast Constitutional Club

But, but, but, but now that, now that, now that, now that then� assertion being that he's in Wye Street and that it can be going off Victoria Channel and we don't know where that is, ahm then we don't know the reason why he would be at the Conn Club because if it's not that he's, if it's not that its pinging on the closest mast then we don't know why it's on Conn Street it doesn't necessarily support your assertion that he is in the vicinity that, that, that East Belfast Conn Club is the closest mast. 
Yes I get what you're saying but we do have it there in black and white that it's pinging offthat at that time and (inaudible). 
Yes we do, yes but we don't know why, but we don't know why, we don't know why, if you can't explain, but is it not the case if you can't explain why it's not pinging offthe Victmia ...

If sometimes it doesn't ping off the closest mast then in, in, in regard to what you're saying, or else it's not, or else it'sjust not him on Wye Street is the other part of it, or else it'sjust not, there is that asse1tion.

Clothes that you don't account for or again movements you don't account for Walter. Again ah we touched on the DDRs okay. At the time of the murder I've indicated to you that you're down in the lower area here, okay, in the Cluan Place. And again I would ask you to account for your movements at 20 past 9 when Ian Ogle is stabbed Walter. Where were you?

moving in that director. 
Yeah. 
But which is moving further away from the Mountpottinger but in 
the direction of either the, the Ballymacan-ett or the other mast. 
Ahnha. 
But you say then at 2124 they connect to Central Station? 
21 ah, where am I at, 21 :24:08 it is registering at Central Station.

direction.

Which might again not support the asse1iion that a phone will 
always go to the ... 
No, but it is ... 
Closest mast. 
As I say it's putting him nearer the scene of the murder, okay 
because you were involved Walter, is that not the case.

No but, yeah, it's a phone closer to the murder ... 
Yes (inaudible). 
As you, to, to the murder scene ...

SOLICITOR SOLICITOR  And then at some point at 2n128 is it, going across here, but in previous interviews it was some sort of zig-zag movement across ah maybe parallel to Templemore Avenue, but how, how does that support then the phone pinging off Central Station? Why would Mountpottinger still not be the ... Again the DDRs, it's not the correct map, okay. Yeah.  
SOLICITOR  But again I would advise you that down the line ... Yeah.  
SOLICITOR  A better map will be produced and now is your earliest opportunity to account for any of these movements. Ah telephone evidence shows no activity on the phone we attribute to you, the number ending ah 290 Walter after 22:n10:n15 seconds it is eventually switched off at 2246 and never heard of or never seen again because you've destroyed it. Cell site analysis shows you have been on the move at the same time as Glen Rainey before the murder and at the Wye Street during the clean-up and that you absconded to Scotland the next day with Greg Edgar ... Sorry just there you say that at, at Wye Street during the clean-up, ah, what mast was that at, BallymacmTett area? Is that from 2n124 BallymacmTett? Yes.  
SOLICITOR  So are you saying then that at 2124 that when you were at Wye Street that you ping off the BallymacmTett mast but at ah 202n1 which is an hour earlier if you are at Wye Street then you ping off ahm Victoria Central?  
SOLICITOR  I can't comment again on the .n.n. Is that not like, is that not a whole like load of ditliculties with the DDR?

where the phone is at the time. Yeah. But it does come back to that, that's all we can say at this point in time ... 
Yeah that's all, that's all I'm saying yes. 
It just, in fact 1 think you had said ah he's in East Belfast and moving about, I think that's how you had said it Danny. Hmm hmm. In the, in the general area. Okay. What I would reiterate is that my colleague said earlier on it miITors 
the movements of Glen ... Glen Rainey. Rainey's ah DDRs on his phone. Hmm hmm. Which is quite significant that they are pinging off the same masts at 
the same time which would suggest they were together. Okay and that the following morning ah you absconded to Scotland 
ah with Greg Edgar and you were aITested (knocking at door, door opens) on your return. Ian Davis just enteting the room at 1550. Ahm this might explain a 
wee bit more okay in relation to the cell site. I know it's been back and faith here. Hmm hmm.

The Ballymacan-ett one is up at the top end and then you've got Mountpottinger over to the side and then actually where the murder scene is would be Central Station. So what we're saying is the phone is on the move and Danny has covered the different cell sites, but at 2124 what we are saying is then suspects are seen running across Ternplemore back towards in the direction ofBallyrnacat1'ett but as Emma says, the cells all cross over each other, okay. I don't know if that helps explain where places are, Central Station is actually where the murder scene is. 
That's where the mast is? Yeah. Yeah and then you have Mountpottinger over this side and 
Ballymacarrett is at the top end which would be crossing over into your home address direction. Okay. I don't know if you want that or not. (Door closes). Okay. Okay so that map basically shows the cells and the different 
movements okay and that you're moving about the area. So yeah, well that, that clarification was good actually then ... Yeah. Because you said that the murder occurred at 2119? Hmm lunm. And that Central Station appears to be ah the murder scene, that's 
where the mast is and I suppose this alun yellow here is the catchment area of that? 
Yes. No, no, no that's Mountpottinger. Of the, of the, of yeah the catchment area of the Mountpottinger 1nast , ..

Well there is no time for 21n19.  
SOLICITOR SOLICITOR  Yeah. But you are saying that as you move around that your phone will just link to the closest thing, so one would assume that if you are in an area which is not covered by the overlap that your phone would have gone to Central Station at 211n9'? I can't say where it ... Look I'm not, I'm not an expert on it either, but it just seems to me that that is the ...  
SOLICITOR SOLICITOR  I know, it doesn't give you a second by second, you know, thing, so obviously there is movement in between (inaudible) you know. At 21n19 there is no register ... I know your phone doesn't ping every so11 of minute or whatever it just depends on the network and things, it's not ... Okay, ah Walter then ..n.

RAINEY No comment. A last minute thing because you from this picture are involved in the murder of Ian and you've had to get away, isn't that correct Glen. RAINEY No comment. And you go away with Johnny Brown who returned from Thailand and myself and my colleague here interviewed him and he admits some role in the murder, isn't that correct. RAINEY No comment. And you travel with him because yous, yous were both involved. RAINEY No comment. So at this stage what was your role Glen. RAINEY No comment. In the murder. 
SOLICITOR Just to be clear I'd don't think he does admit a role in the murder with Mr Brown. Emm. 
SOLICITOR He admits being present (inaudible). Present, I accept that, yeah that's (inaudible). 
SOLICITOR Yeah I know but just so he knows that's slightly misleading cause he doesn't admit on the murder. Ok, ok. Em so Johnny, Johnny Brown admits being present

So then em I think Neil Ogle was obviously present at that and that's then em Neil's saying been involved on the Sunday, the Sunday night em with what had happened with RyanJohnston and Ian Ogle who had beat him up. Now em there's some suggestion maybe that there's a bit of involvement with

Johnathan Brown's obviously got off side, is that, was you were doing too trying to get off side, 
RAINEY No comment. 
Cause obviously that wouldn't be you wouldn't think unless it'slike a family holiday or something, it wouldn't be the actions of sort of like an innocent person if you like, if, if you're involved in this that would appear to be the actions of somebody who's trying to get away from what has happened, is that the case.

No comment. Who brought it. No comment. Did you bring it. No comment. Did you know it was there. No comment. They were hitting him in the back and he went down, so the 
Minister's describing it's not just one person assaulting Ian it's at least a couple. Were you involved in this assault. 
No comment. Eh they continued eh to attack him and then started to walk away. The smallest one in the grey hoodie stamped on Ian's head as well as kicking him. He stamped on his head eh four to five times. Again was that you. 
No comment. Or do you know who was doing that. No comment. One of the injuries we talked about eh that Ian suffered was a 
fractured skull, quite a serious injury. Did you cause that injury to Ian. No comment. Or again do you want to tell us who did.

brisk, briskly after the others. Again are you one of the 
others. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Ian was wearing a blue hoodie which was pulled up over his head and his right side was exposed, he was lying in the recovery position and was groaning. Eh the Minister thought his neck might have been broken due to having his head stamped on. Eh he laid his hands on Ian, Ian's belly and prayed and he stated that Ian eh was breathing but 'not heavily. Ian's son Ryan then arrived and the Minister rang 999 on Ryan's phone. Ian was bleeding, there was a pool of blood beside him but not a heavy flow from anywhere in particular. There also seemed to be a number of puncture wounds, the eleven stab wounds we've talked about. As the ambulance arrived eh Ian's eyes were half open and glazed, the ambulance crew got Ian into the ambulance and they appeared to be carrying out CPR on him ok and he subsequently brought to the hospital ok. Were you one ofthose males.

Is there anything you want to tell us about what the Minister has described. 
No comment. 
Eh a second witness then eh with the name Andrew ok eh described eh Ryan Johnston as his best friend. Andrew saw Ian Ogle standing at the top of Cluan Place and Andrew saw 'Ogie', em with a quotation mark, standing talking to another unknown male ok. We believe this male is the, the Minister we've just talked about. Again do you know that Ian Oglewent by the nickname 'Ogie'. 
No comment. 
Andrew then stood talking to Ogie and the Minister at the footpath in Cluan Place. Two or three minutes later Andrew saw two or three males eh running down the Albertbridge Road, again I'll refer to the picture, eh from the Templemore Avenue area. He describes them as wearing hats, scarfs and neck warmers. As they got closer he saw there seven males and he describes some of the offenders as follows: Eh male one was wearing grey jacket with a hood up and also wearing a ski mask, hat or scarf eh and possibly carrying a telescopicchrome coloured flick back. Ok so again so another witness is describing someone bringing a bat or a baton to, to, to the assault ok. Out you know clearly in the open ok before eh the assault occurs ok which would indicate that yous knew there was weapons being brought, isn't that the case Glen. 
No comment. 
That male hit Ogie forty to fifty times to the head, face and shoulders, em described him as in his late twenties/earlythirties and approximately five foot nine/five foot ten. Eh Andrew then said that's enough lads, eh that male replied to him that's a fuckin nough before hitting Ogie again and again. Eh the male described as not being stocky ok. Is that you Glen. 
No comment. 
Are you the one that brought the bat.

All of the gang bar one ran off in the direction of Templemore Avenue and as I said back up to where the, the Seat Leon was parked ok, round the corner in Langtry Court.

So that goes back to the, the Minister's previous statement about the smaller gentleman he describes as stamping on Ogie's head, was that you. 
RAINEY No comment.

He was doing it as hard as he could (inaudible) it's written as actually says he was smaller than the rest of the groupattacking Ogie. That male then ran off in the same direction as the others. The male was up to Andrew's nose and height, slim build, wearing something tight around his head that was dark coloured. He was wearing a dark coloured eh longsleeved hoodie or jacket and dark coloured bottoms on. I don't believe that is you, I don't believe you're the, the smallest eh Glen but can you tell us who that was. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Obviously em Glen you know on that night the tensions are high and everybody's (inaudible) and you know em everybody's then attacking Ian, they're like a pack of hyena's and this is all you know sort of in a frenzy at that stage.Obviously we're sitting now a few weeks later in the cold light of day and you involved in this, how does that make you feel listening to all of that.

2ylh
it was approximately 2120 hours on Sunday the of January 2019. He heard yelling and then observed a group of people running on the opposite side of the street. There seemed to be two separate groups, as we've the previous witness, eh and four or five in each group. So between eight and ten people in total so it's a larger group. He thought there were two groups as there was approximately five metres between them, they were running from the Albertbridge Road direction and as they passed Langtry Court he noticed one of the males was carrying a large knife in his right hand. It had the blade length of six to nine inches and a depth of two inches. He then observed that all the males had balaclavas on or scarfs around their heads and they were all wearing dark clothing. They're all relatively fit, lean in build and were all over five foot eight in height and he would assess them to be eighteen to twenty-one due to the way they moved. Ok are you right or left handed. 
No comment. 
Eh the first group of males continued running and then turned into Mid, Madrid Street. The second group of males then ran into Langtry Court and got into a vehicle. The witness couldn't give any of the descriptions of the males involved em but the car came out onto Templemore Avenue and turned left along the New1ownards Road and then turned right into what he thought was eh Major Street ok here on the map, ok Glen. Eh the car eh was a black Seat Leon with the registration VRM JCZ 7 406 ok.

Ian was then contacted by a messenger from the UVF saying that an appointment was made for him to attend to have both his arms broken because he shouldn't have started in the bar and waited until twenty-four hours for cooling off period. Ian refused to attend this appointment, eh the harassment and intimidation has been happening since according to this witness ok. Emma alleged that on the 1 st Neil Ogle eh witnessed the assault in the Prince Albert but not did not intervene and walk away. Em the incident was not reported to police. Ok so eh Emma's basically saying a fight has gone on ok between one group, eh yourself on this side and the Ogle's themselves, Ian, Vera, Toni and Ryan ok and basically Neil Ogle has not taken the side of his family, has not intervened,has stayed out of it for one for a better word, is that what's happened.

RAINEY No comment. 
So what I want to talk to you about is phones, I've been doing the investigation into this enqui1y with telephones and people's use, who's been contacting who and where we can sort of say where they've been, em and I want to talk about your telephone number in particular.

RAINEY No comment. 
As you're aware my colleague's explained that Johnathan Brown has been interviewed in relation to this and is currentlycharged with the connection of the murder of Ian Ogle and you're aware of that, is that correct. Em so I've done a lot of stuff around him in particular as well and calls that he's made on the night the 2?1". I'm just going to show you some of this, I didn't think really it's going to be so large but this is basically calls that Johnathan Brown has made em to a telephonenumber which we believe to be your own on the evening of the 2?1h and what this basically shows us is what sort of communication ii was, now if ii was a text message ii would just say text message it wouldn't say call, the date it happened and the time and then the duration. For example a call 42 second call, 8 second call, 11 second call and this telephone numberis what we believe is Johnathan Brown's telephone number which is 07 493097038, does that telephone number look familiar to you at all. 
RAINEY No comment. 
That telephone number has been provided by family members of Johnathan Brown as being his own telephone number, so we're pretty certain that that is his telephone number that he was using on the 2yth of January. For what you can see here basically this is from the whole of the 2yth and this 

communication that we see that he starts contacting this telephone number which is 0751t1206614, he starts calling it at five minutes to nine, it's the first contact he makes with it. Now this telephone number that ends 614 do you recall this is your telephone number Mr Rainey. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Do you know anybody that could be using that telephonenumber. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Now the reason it's important cause obviously we know that Johnathan Brown was involved in the murder of Ian Ogle,through his vehicle em and during the interview he even stated that he was there at the incident. I\Jow he starts phoning a number we think is yours at five to nine, do youknow why he would have called you then.

Mr Rainey. This 1t9 second call does seem quite quick but with 19 second you can a lot of things with 1t9 seconds. Now this I believe is shortly after the fight at the chip shop with Ian Ogle, Ian Ogle and Ryan Johnston, is he calling you to saythere's been a fight here, we're going to get something sorted with Ian Ogle. 
No comment. 
Go round to the house and maybe and sort something out. 
No cornment. 
Now we know before this Neil Ogle has contacted Johnathan Brown, now obviously just telephone call we don't know what the content was but it was after the assault. So straight after Neil Ogle phones Johnathan Brown he's phoning you and we can show he has phoned other people that we believe is involved in this. The next call then is at 2104 he phones you for a 7 second call, do you recall what that was for. 
No comment. 
This is obviously the build up, Johnathan Brown knows what's happened and by now by this call I'd say you probably know what happened and there's a build up really to going round,do something with Ian Ogle. Next call then he does at 2108 for 14 seconds, do you recall that Mr Rainey at all. 
No comment. 
2205 now this is afterthe murder of Ian Ogle, he contacts you again for a longer one a 42 second call, do you recall that at all. 
No comment. 
2217, 8 second, do you recall that contact. 
No comment. 
And 2219, 11 second, this is the last time he contacts you.

You don't recall that all. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Just while you're showing that there just to emphasis the timescale that we went through yesterday then, so 2040 sobefore this one Is the time Neil Ogle is assaulted ok, 2108 the call and then 2114 is the CCTV we showed you outside the Albert Bar and then it moves on to the Glider stops at the murder ok, so that's where, where you're fitting into it. 
So we've taken all this from basically the call records from Johnathan Brown's phone. We just need to apply to 02 and they send us all the billing basically all the numbers they are going to charge him for and these are all the contacts he's done. We can also apply to see who owns this telephone number from 02, basically it's a subscriber check they call it and that was applied for and what came back was basicallyyour details, so you've obviously registered this telephone number in your name, do you recall that at all Mr Rainey. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Now this is the actual words that are on it. Subscriber detail came back said Mr Glen Colin, now I'm not sure whether that's Colin could be a spelling error if you did it online, James Rainey, your date of birth was on it and your address as well. So this is one telephone number that's obviously been billed to you, do you recall the telephone now Mr Rainey. 
RAINEY No comment. 
I mean you could say that somebody else registered it in your name but then the bills are going to your address and you are paying the bills. It's an old telephone number as well, you've had it since 2015 they tell us. 
RAINEY No comment. 
And it's a long time, I would sort of know my telephone number if I had it for a few, few years at least. So do you recall your telephone number at all Mr Rainey. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Because we knew it was your telephone number we basically asked then for all your call data for the day. Em it really

started from eight o'clock when we believe the built up to all this happens, so eight o'clock on the 2ih up until your phone basically stops being used we have all the data for it and this what all this is it's all a large spreadsheet basically telling you all the stuff that's in it and I just want to go through a few bits and what I've put into this one as well is all the contact with Johnathan Brown. So all the ones that you see here, GPRS it starts from eight o'clock and GPRS is basically when you'reusing your phone for Whatsapp or Facebook and what'II happen is it will register that as being used which is quite important in a minute. It shows the calls then the calls that you've received from Johnathan Brown, more GPRS and then device event which is basically if you turn your phone on using m<1ps or ::;omething it will just register where. the phone's being used and this goes all the way through, you can see the time here all the way through then continuing on so it's b<!sically registering your phone in different locations all the way through. Nine o'clock more events, nine o'clock Johnathan Brown phones you at ten, there'st� calls here to other people, see a call to Mark Rainey, is that your brother. 
RAINEY No comment. 
I believe Mark Rainey. Continues on through then all these events it's all recorded basically where the phone's been used into the early hours and then even the next day on the 281h when you waken up in the morning it's registering when thingsare being used and it shows up people that you've contacted and things that's happened the next day. -We see the next morning just, I just want to point out to you you can see you'rephoning the Slieve Denard Hotel, is there a reason wh\' you're phoning the Slieve Denard Hotel on the 281h Mr Rainey.

No comment. 
Again was yourtrip away to Thailand pre planned. 
No comment. 
Or it seems to be a spare ofthe moment thing. 
No comment. 
All the data then continues on down continues into the 29th but what we can see here on the left hand side is call forwarded, so basically what that means is it's gone to your voicemail so your phone's not being used, your phone's basically off. So what we basically think is your text messages was the last thing that you received on the 28th at around half four in the afternoon, so we think your phone's gone by then. We also know what type of phone that you had at this time which was an lphone XS, do you still have that phone Mr Rainey. 
No comment. 
Now we can tell this basically from the, the information the phone company gives us they can tell us what phone is being used. So we know it's an !tphone XS and you don't have a phone anymore, you didn't come back with a phone from Thailand (inaudible).

RAINEY phoning you quite a few times before and 
after. The next morning you're phoning hotels and airlines and then yourphone goes dead in the afternoon, doesn't come back on again. 
No comment. 
Is there any reason for that. 
No comment. 
Were you told to get rid of your phone. 
No comment. 
Does somebody else have your phone, did they take it off you. 
No comment. 
Now we've all this information we get as I say we get details of the phone you're using and also the mast, telephone mast that you're using and I'm sure you're aware how it works, I'm not going to insult your intelligence, if you're phone's used a certain cell mast would pick up and use you'd be using that mast really for the call or to send messages for example and they're dotted around the place, you can sort of see them on buildings and stuff and that's the one you're going to use and what that does each of them has a range which only goes so far and can only pick up certain areas. So if you're using your phone for example in Belfast it's not going to be using a mast in Lisburn hills somewhere cause it just won't reach, ok. So we've got all the information, everything's that happened here, for all the GPRS events, for all the device events which is basically if you even turn your phone on or you get an advert using the torch for example and all the calls that you make on the telephone. So all that data basically we've put in and mapped out of where your phone's been on the 27th of January. I'm going to show you this which is a map of the area which is quite similar to the one you've shown with all the locations in it. For example here's just small pointers at the bottom which is one to five which points out locations of interest, you have Cluan Place down the bottom here just off the Albertbridge Road, you have over here number 2 which is Wye Street which is beside the Prince Albertbridge Bar which is number 5, em you have Pitt Place and Wolfe Close where we believe the black Seat Leon that was involved in the 
13 



-1137 hours 
murder was deposited, em and that's really all the locations on there. We also have the letter C which is believed is 1O McArthur Court, is that your home address. 
No comment. 
Can you confirm that is 1 O McArthur Court there on the map. 
No comment. 
Just down here I've put a quick time which says the black Seat Leon this is when it's observed coming out of Wye Street on CCTV and heading towards the, the Prince AlbertbridgeBar which is number 5 on the map here and that's where we believe the black Seat Leon is taking people up to the bar to all go in and have a go at, who's the people in the bar do you remember, the ladies in the bar, there's an altercation in the bar really following the fight with Neil Ogle. So this is basically between 211O and 2116, we can see that yourphone is basically being used in this area you can see greyed out and what this is telling us is basically this telephone mast here which is called the Mountpottinger East Mast is basically picking up you phone in this area and it can only be this area because this is where the cell mast goes to. Do you see it goes all the way up there so it must be sort of facing the front of the road so it's catching all the way up the road and stopsthere, it doesn't go past into McArthur Court. So we can sayyour phone which we believe you're using at the time is not in your house and you're down here at the Prince Albert Bar at the time the black Seat Leon is pulling up outside and go in and have an altercation in there before the murder of Ian Ogle. Would that be correct. 
No comment. 
Is there any other reason you could be in this area between ten past nine and sixteen minutes past nine on the 2?'h. 
No comment. 
If there's a genuine reason then, then this is the time to saycause we can say that you're there at the Prince Albert Bar in that car and you're not in your home address or you're not out of this area.

SOLICITOR Em you know with this I find it slightly hard and by no means do I think you are being misleading that this is the shape, is it not the case that the catchment area can go as far as here cause, cause I'm, I'm not the expert and I do know. 
(Inaudible) yes.

SOLICITOR And, and, and that was police's own evidence so what I find and you're right to put the case to him, don't think for any stretch of the imagination. 
No you're alright. 
SOLICITOR I, I just think it's very hard to believe em from what I've learned lately. 
Yeah. 
SOLICITOR In a, in a murder trial that the shape of the catchment is here. 
Right. 
SOLICITOR I mean I, I think it's, it's more than that. 
Alright. 
SOLICITOR Em and you're right to say we say you're phone's in this area cause we're putting a murder charge to you. 
Yeah. 
SOLICITOR But I, I just, is that, I mean that's fair to say, I'm not an expert but that's. 
Well I'll tell you how they get this detail is what we do is we do a survey of all the cell masts em which basically means we have equipment that you put in a car em and it'll pick up whatever mast it can pick up, it's quite strong so even if there's a weak signal like on a mountain, ten miles away it could pick it up sort of say yes if all these masts are really busy and there's not enough capacity you'll be able to use that mast over there, that's what I can, It can say and what this has is we have a car with all this equipment in it and it drives round all the streets and it'll pick up every single signal it can in every single area and register it on a map and it'll basically every like ten metres or so it'll just collect the cell data and see who's it picking up, who's it picking up, but what happens is for this mast in particular which is a Mountpottinger East mast as you see the car with all the equipment was driving up the Newtownards Road and when it gets to this point it is not picking up this mast anymore. Em it's driven along Tamar Street or I think it is, em it's gotten to this point and it's stopped picking it up. The car's driven all

these routes and the car's been in em McArthur Court and it's not picking up this mast at all. 
SOLICITOR Ok. 
Em I mean by all means there is, if this was a high rise and you were standing on top of it, it is possible to pick it up cause this is a survey taken from a car at ground level but you can sort of see it doesn't pick up in any streets along here and it just goes up to the points that I've marked out on the map ok. 
SOLICITOR And when was this survey carried out. 
This was carried out em I believe two days after the murder but a survey as well the equipment I'm going to give too much away but the equipment. 
SOLICITOR (inaudible). 
(inaudible) historical reasons em and if there has been anychanges to the mast it will register changes and stuff so I can see if this has been updated like�all 5G's coming in, if it's been updated to 5G then it'll tell that and they'll say there might be an error because there has been changes to the mast but this reading's taken when the mast hasn't been changed at all. 
SOLICITOR Ok. 
And that's been done with all of them. 
SOLICITOR It's done with all, all within all the (inaudible). 
Well all the masts that are on here and all the suspects. 
SOLICITOR Ok. 
Em so you see all these masts, I'll just point to you there as well where we're going on, em these are the main masts that surround the area, there's none in the middle so they're all sort of pointing then towards the area in particular and youhave one, two, three, four, four main masts and one that's up beside eh the Odyssey which picks up something irrelevant to yourself Mr Rainey. So what we can see basically for this mast it is picking up your phone in this area and not at the home address, so is there any reason you would be in this area at all again Mr Rainey before I move on.

Now as you'd expect there's not much activity in fact there's no activity at the time of the murder and what happens is for yourself in particular all the other suspicion taken out of this these details but yourself in particular it does show at 2121 that your telephone is being used in the mast beside Central Station which is beside Cluan Place. So number 1 's Cluan Place and this is the cell mast that you are using. Now this shows just shortly after the murder, 2121, this is when we can actually see on CCTV the five males walking away from the murder scene on that, that seems to be al the road and what we can see is you have moved away from the area of the Prince Albert Bar and you're down into this catchment area. Now what I wiil confirm is it does cover your home address but what it does show is that you have moved away from the area where we believe exactly the movements of the black Seat Leon follow also. Is the reason there are you home there or are you out and about in that area Mr Rainey. 
No comment. 
Are you walking past the bus stop then the CCTV which we believe you are. 
No comment. 
Or where were you at this lime. 
No comment. 
Who were you with. 
No comment. 
Did anyone else have your phone. 
No comment. 
21t12's the same then you're phone's still being used in this area. 2123 still in the area. Now what we can see is then it jumps forward to 2137, now this is the time that we see the black Seat Leon on CCTV travelling along the Newtownards Road and then you're back onto this mast which directs all the way up the Newtownards Road at 2137, so you're not in your house anymore if you were before and what we believe is you were down at the murder scene and then you're now

Jumping again 2146 you're still out of your home address, still down in the area of Wye Street, Prince Albertbridge Bar, Newtownards Road. Now this is the time that Johnathan Brown's phoning you as well. This time we believe Johnathan Brown's up with the car on the other side of East Belfast, that's obviously why he's phoning you cause you're not together anymore. 
RAINEY No comment. 2153 you're still out of your house, is there a reason you'reout of your house at this time, is there a genuine reason. RAINEY No. You're not involved in all this, you want to tell us about. RAINEY No comment. We're still in the area of the Prince Albert Bar, are you there

SOLICITOR No cause I thought I, I thought I got it wrong recently in the trial, yeah, yeah that's fine ok. No, no, no, no. What we're, what we're basically showing 
with this is from the previous maps is you are moving about at the time of the murder, the time when this car is on the Prince Albert em Bridge bar you are here in this whole area which does cover the bar, you're not in your house. So if we're going to say you were at the bar we can say yeah your phone's in the area, you're not in your house. 
SOLICITOR Yeah, no, (inaudible), I get that. Do you know what I mean, I'm just trying to explain that. And I'm not saying you are at the bar I'm saying this is the

Is there any reason your phone's out of the house, does somebody else have your phone.

It's a good phone I wouldn't give it to anybody else either. The movements then what we can show from all the data that we hijve is thi!t once yotJ le.c1ve thill ctrna .aJter all this to clean up we believe, is all done, everybody's going their separate ways, your phone's then in a different area completely. When you're basically the phone is being used in Braniel west mast, close to the Braniel Estate, do you know anybody up in that area Mr Rainey. 
RAINEY No comment. 
If the phone is being used it's all GPRS data which is basically you on Whatsapp, Facebook, using your phone or it could even be voice em calls over the internet sort of thing, but it does show that you are using it In the Braniel west mast which points straight into the Braniel Estate, did you go there after all this. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Is the reason why you didn't go home. 
RAINEY No comment. 
And we asked you yesterday about an address in the Braniel yesterday, Wincroft Road, 25D, is that where you were. 
RAINEY No comment. 
This is all this information here, you can see it's all GPRS. It gives the time then this is the morning early hours of the 28th at 0142 hours and it's showing then Braniel west and there is more details we can get what direction it's pointing and for example but just to show that you are out of the area where you live and out of East Belfast area, you're sort of more Braniel direction and this carries on basically it gets stopped

To be honest if I actually show you this is the road it was passed, there's a garage here on the right hand side as you're going towards Castlereagh, this is the road where the mast is on you were picking up and the mast was pointing into the estate so you weren't this side you were basically in this area, early hours of the morning and then the next morning in Braniel west. Your phone was there was there any reason why your phone was not anywhere else apart from this area at this time. 
RAINEY No, no comment. 
And the next morning when you wake up we know that using this mast because this was the mast used on the phoneAeroflot and airlines and the hotels. Were you not allowed to stay wherever you were in the Braniel Estate, did you have to go somewhere else, is that why you're phoning hotels. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Right Johnathan Brown came back as well we did get a phone from him that he was using over there and what we do with mobile phones is we can basically do an examination of them and get all the information of them rather than having to go through the phone manually and look at messages and see who you've called. Em we do an examination and it pulls everything off basically on a report form like a spreadsheet for all the messages and all the things that's happening and this is basically what was on his Whatsapp records of his mobile phone that was seized when he came back. I just want to point a few things out to you just to see if you have anycomment to make in relation to them. He's talking to Orla who I believe is his sister, okay and this is what he's saying. He's basically saying on one of the messages I'd rather be home before him as he knows his part in this as well so I don't want to be linked to the cause of this, my head's in a good place, do you know what it could be referring to there. 
RAINEY No comment. 
And I believe Johnathan Brown went with you to Thailand and he was out there and this was on the 4th of February so he would have been there then, is he referring to yourself there when he says he wants to get home before you.

RAINEY  No comment.  
And again tell me now it could be totally unrelated.  
RAtINEY  No comment.  
Ok. I'm just going to talk about em some other items then.  
Ok em Glen I just want to show you these. Eh they're marked AMCV35 and 36 and they're 35 is a right, maroon and white Adidas trainer and eh 36 is the left trainer. Now these were  
taken out of your property, em you can probably, can you see them there.

Ok. Can you tell me where you've got those.  
RAINEY  No comment.  
Em were you wearing those on the night of the murder.

Cause obviously what we believe we've� shown you the photograph of eh the clothing and stuff that em we believe you were wearing that night which you can see the jacket, the light coloured em sort of tracksuit type bottoms and trainers which appear to be white trainers, are they the same trainers as we have here.  
RAINEY  No comment.  
And obviously the bobble hat and we've talked about em Glen that clothing before and that you know we don't have that clothing, we couldn't find that clothing so the belief is that that clothing was perhaps destroyed aftBtr eh after thB murder of Ian, was that correct.

RAINEY No comment. So if you went somewhere and destroyed that clothing you've obviously em had other trainers because we know that you went to Thailand with no property so were you wearing those trainers whenever you went to the airport. RAINEY No comment. Eh to go to Thailand and obviously em if you have destroyed that clothing that you; we can see you wearing there, you've had to change into different clothing, did you change into those trainers.

Or did you buy those whenever you're in Thailand. RAINEY No comment. Can I ask you this clothing here I say because we haven't found it the assumption is perhaps it was destroyed, is it a case that maybe you didn't destroy that clothing and you maynot have it. RAINEY No comment. And that perhaps you have worn that whenever you went to em the airport. RAINEY No comment.

And we've said to you throughout the process obviously and we've said to you initially about the caution Glen and you know this is your opportunity to tell us and I know your solicitor will have gone through all that but we explained in the first interview obviously if you this matter ends up going to court and you bring up something in court that you've had all this time obviously we've given you everything that we have and you try and make a story fit it's up to the court how much weight they put on that because you could have told us that today you know rather than all that time, is there anythingtoday you want to tell us or anything you want to explain to us.

Just eh on that em Glen obviously you're saying that youweren't involved in it, tell us how you weren't involved in it because that's very little for us to go on you know and as we've said to you in other interviews if you were there tell us that but you, you weren't involved in the actual murder tell us that, this is for you to tell us. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Cause Danny's right that's quite generic, anybody can say I wasn't involved, I didn't do it, but tell us how. 
RAINEY No comment. 
But were you there. 
RAINEY No comment. 
Is it a case you were there and you didn't, you didn't stamp on his head, you didn't punch him, you didn't stab him, is that the case. 
RAINEY No comment. 
You know cause if you were there sometimes you know people get involved in these things you know and, and they're in the middle of it but they've actually you know they haven't actually done anything at all and that's quite important to be honest Glen you know if you haven't done anything, you're saying you weren't involved in the murder, you know if you're there just say yeah I was there but I didn't do that or give us an explanation. 
RAINEY No comment. 
We feel then that we have given you every opportunity em and every sort of thing we can think of about your role in this and we've given you every opportunity to say what your role but you have declined throughout isn't that correct. 
RAINEY No comment. 
And just to really finish off just basically we would say that that you're not giving any comment because you are involved.

He's picked you up in the Seat Leon, yous have gone to the Prince Albert Bar, yous have then driven to Langtry Court parked the car up and then you have got out with the other four males and went down in a, in an attempt to assault Ian and yous weren't expecting him isn't that the case. No comment. 
And you've been caught on the CCTV here in your jacket; in the jacket you were wearing a few days before in the Bank of Ireland, isn't that correct. No comment. 
Glen and after the murder you've either disposed of these clothes or you've kept them but we've never found them and potentially we may see them in the footage from Dublin Airport, isn't that correct.

My naine's Arlene McVeigh, Detective Constable based in Serious Crime in Ladas Drive in Belfast. My colleague today is. Ah Detective Constable Danny Cross also Serious Crime Ladas Drive. And can you state your full name and date of birth for me please. It's Jonathan Brown, 7'' of the 8'" 85. And the other person present today is? Mark Austin, solicitor Bannon Crawford Belfast.  

OK Jonathan obviously you're here today and that's in relation to the murder of Ian Ogle which took place on Sunday the 27th of January 2019 and you've been anested for that offence and I'm going to caution you for that in !hat -You do not have lo say anything but I must caution you that if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court it

may harm your defence but if you do say anything it may be given in evidence. All that means Jonathan is you don't have to speak to me in this interview today but if this matter say six months, a year down the line goes to a court and you bring up something that you could have quite easily told me today it'd be up to the court how much weight they put on that cause you've obviously had all that time to think about it -does that make sense?  
BROWN  Yip.  
OK a few wee bits that I need to read out before we actually start the interview. Ah we're now going to ask you some questions about crime no one should ever admit to something they haven't done or plead guilty to an offence they haven't committed. If you are brought to court for this crime then you can plead not guilty or you can plead guilty. If you plead guilty 

when you're brought to court one of the things the court will look at when passing a sentence is the time when you accepted your guilt. The court will give credit to people who plead guilty at the earliest response or reasonable opportunity in the proceedings. The court may also give credit to those who admit they have committed the crime they're being questioned about during police interviews. Making admissions at interview may lead to a shorter sentence. Pleading guilty at the earliest stage in proceedings may also lead to a shorter sentence. Your solicitor can fully advise you on your rights and if you wish to consult with them about what I have just said please let me know. Do you need to consult about that? 
BROWN 
No. I think it's pretty self-explanatory. Ah Jonathan ah there was some disclosure given to your solicitor today ah I'm jnst going to read that out for ahm for the interview and it says detectives from Serious Crime Branch arc investigating the murder of Jan Ogle which occmTed on Sunday the 27th of January 201n9 at approximately 2130 hours in Cluan Place in Belfast. Police aware that there were five males involved in this murder. Ian Ogle was badly assaulted and stabbed repeatedly. Your client has been arrested for the offences of murder and police are aware that your client was one of the five involved. So the areas that to be discussed in the interview is alun what your client's involvement in the murder of Ian Ogle, date of birth 12'h of the 4th 73 of 4 Cluan Place, Belfast and police want to asce1tain your client's movements on the evemng of the murder especially around 1n800 hours on the 27th of January 2019 until he left Northern Ireland, what vehicles he had access, people he had contact with either face to face or on phone and your client will be asked to confinn the mobile number police believes is attributed to him. Ah throughout the interview process bad character may be introduced. Ah Jonathan obviously I said to

BROWN SOLICITOR  That's To clear up Jonathan' s been advised. Listen it the the what what my concern 1s now I think there's been at least twice where Jonathan's been told by police we know you're involved now interview process so can you put questions to him rather than saying we know you're involved or else say here's how we know you're involved. I do have a problem with you saying we know you 're involved  
SOLICITOR  OK. the DS has said this already but from pre-interview disclosure and from what you're saying let let's put him there and then he'll maybe make an assessment as to what he's going to say.  
OK cause this is this is a process Jonathan you know and as as the day goes on you will be made ah fully aware of of

everything that we  
SOLICITOR  Yes Know and I understand that but obviously from police's point of view we need to find out what your account is you know what you're saying and we know you know that there's been other people in so we need to check the veracity of your account as well against everyone else's.  
SOLICITOR  We we do appreciate that but ah he's in, as an independentsolicitor ah I think now it's potentially the fourth time he's been told we know you're there let's tell him how he's there. Let's, let's, let's go with the process rather than jumping ah ah  
'  And as I say it it is a process and you you will be made aware of that so ahm your solicitor's asked me to ask questions and that is what I'm asking you I'm just asking you questions as to where you were, who you were with you !mow you can either tell us all of that to speed all of that up or else we just go through the motions of asking you every question beca  
SOLICITOR  Yeah DC McVeigh ah ah say saying we know you're there is not a question, it's statement.

No comment. Or would you have driven your own car along the Beersbridge Road? No comment. And what about Jill's car? No comment. Cause we know that you were in Jill's car on ahm Sunday night so would you have driven Jill's car at all along the Beersbridge Road? No comment. Or would yon have got out and walked along there? No cotmnent. OK so The fight ahm happened So At ah about 10 to nine if you weren't on the Beersbridge Road where were were you at that time? No comment. Know might be a case you're not on the Beersbridge Road but you could be anywhere else then so where were you at this time? No comment. Because if you look at number 13 up here this is where Jill lives and Jill's your partner now obviously we've spoken to Jill and Jill would say that you were with her at ah some part of the night do you want to tell me about that? No comment. OK ahm were you in your car with Jill at any stage? No comment. Did you drive the car with Jill in it? 
No comment. 
Did she drive the car with you in it? 
No comment. 
So I think it's ahm Wolff Court is it Wolff Close she lives and then at the back of it sort of Pitt Place there just there and this is where as you can see there's like a wee alcove just in there at Pitt Place is this did you abandon the car there after the murder? 
BROWN BROWN  No comment. And would you nonnally park the car sort of along Pitt Place whenever you 're parking it? Where would you normally park ah .lill's car? No comment. And what about your own car where would you normally park

that?  
BROWN  No comment.  
OK so as yous can see then that obviously goes on to the  
Newtownards Road do you frequent any of the bars along here I  
think there's there's the Albert Bar is just at the comer of the  
Albertbridge there would you ever be in the like of there?  
BROWN  No comment.  
And what about any of the other bars in the area?  
BROWN  No comment.  
So what we know is from our enquiries obviously Jill's car is  
involved ahm and obviously we'll be checking like CCTV things  
like that so did you d1ive whenever you leave Jill's house where  
did you drive to?  
BROWN  No comment.  
--\,  Did you drive down the Newtownards Road towards the Albert Bar?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Or would you have driven out towards Bridge End?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Obviously we we know this is the Albe1ib1idge Road and then on  
this is Templemore Avenue I take it you're familiar with all of  
that all of that area it's just are you ah I think that's the area that  
you live in anyway are you familiar with all of that?  
BROWN  No comment.  
So this is the Templemore Avenue and this is where we believe  
that the car was parked up in Langtree Court and then as you can  
see as you come along from Templemore A venue leads you on to  
the Albcrtbridge Road there and just to Cluan Place where the  
murder has taken place so tell me whenever you leave what time  
you leave Wolff Close and leave Jill at?  
J:JROWN  No comment.  
.�  And what time do you get in to Jill' s car at?  
BROWN  No comment.  
And is Jill's car parked then in Pitt Place?  
BROWN  No comment.  
I know I think that's mainly the only direction by the looks of it  
you can come out on to the Newtownards Road would that be  
right or is there I suppose you could come up this way but it all  
seems to bring you back round to the N ewtownards Road so  
would you have gone on to the Newtownards Road?  

BROWN  No comment.  
And at any stage did you pick anyone up?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Was there any arrangements to pick anyone up?

BROWN 
No comment. Anything that you know a simple explanation other than the explanation that we're saying is cause it was involved in the murder?

So if you can tell us where you were at that time you know it's obviously going to be helpful to you if you can tell us where you were? No comment. Or if you can tell us the reason why Jill's car's parked in Langtree Court. No comment. Because we know that Jill would say that you were in the car so we know that you were dtiving the car so if there's a an easyexplanation you know do you know people here, did you go and visit anyone, is there anything like that or is it just simply the fact that you were to bring the car to bring the others No comment. For the murder? After the murder takes place then ahm obviously ah the only way is back on to the Albertbridge Road is that the way you came? No comment. And we know that there's five people involved so did the five of you then come back round towards Langtree Court? No comment. And did yous all walk from Jang or from Cluan round to Langtree or did yous run? No comment. Cause I I would imagine there must be a bit of urgency about that obviously somebody's been stabbed, beaten and dead so there I would imagine there's some s01t of urgency so did yous run? No comment. And whenever you come back alun to Langtree who all got in to the car? No comment. At any stage would you have walked any of this area or have you always been in the car the whole time No comment. Apart from when you get out to go round to Cluan Place for the murder? No comment. 
So did everyone get back in the car was there five people BROWN

leave or were you on your own whenever you're driving the car back?

Page 13 ofl9 So what route then would you have taken ahm from Langtree Court cause obviously we know that the car is found in Pitt Place ahm da where did you go straight back to Pitt Place? No comment. Or did you drop the others off anywhere? No comment. Or as I'd have asked in the last interview did you to go to someone's house to get rid of maybe clothing to clean the car to do anything did you go to anyone else's house? No comment. Cause what we believe is this car then leaves Langtree and maybe goes up one of these street maybe Major Street or one of the other streets is that the route you would have taken? No c01mnent. Cause obviously any of those streets then bring you back up to ah Belvoir Street or 'Beaver' Street I'm not sure which the proper pronunciation and then ah would bring you back onto the N ewtownards Road is that the route you took? No comment. Because ah you could have obviously came back down then Templemore Avenue and along the Albe1tbridge did you do that? No comment. Oh would think that'd be nnlikely considering that's where the murder has taken place but it is a possibility so I have to ask you if that's the route you've taken? No comment. Or did yous drive back past Cluan Place then? No comment. Maybe along Mountpottinger and along and back round you know take a lengthier route round? No cmmnent. So can you tell me where you went from that car's in Langtree Court? 
BROWN No comment. 
From Langtree core from the time of the murder to you get back to Langtree Court ah to the car is found in Pitt Place tell me where you were, what you done and who you were with? 
BROWN  No comment.  
Ah was everybody still in the car at that stage?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Anything else you want?  
Ahm no, no that's fine.  
Happy enough. OK ahm anything Jonathan you want to say about that about the the route ahm it's obviously it's quite a a small tight area anything that you want to tell me about that or you know why why Jill's car's in Langtree Comt, is there an easy

BROWN  No.  
BROWN  OK so ahm in Pitt Place then ahm we know that you have left Pitt Place and obviously we've checked CCTV and stuff that'll all come later on but I think suffice to say just that ahm you can see the Seat Leon coming up the Albertbridge Road to the Albert Bar ahm you can see you getting out there seems to be about four people there and ahm so can you tell me who the four are? No comment.  
BROWN  OK so there there are people getting out of that so the the all that seems to be obviously from what we can see on CCTV seems to be right you've either picked other people up or you've met other people and there's people in this ear getting out at the Albert Bar .can you tell me why yous went to the Albert Bar? No comment.  

And what the reason was? 
BROWN i  No comment. Cause what what we believe that the reason was is that Neil has rang you or rang someone but we believe ahm Neil has rang you now we know that you would know Neil because Neil has been in here and he's telling us yeah he knows you from school I think yous all went Ashfield would that be conect?  
BROWN  No comment. So you're, you're maybe a wee bit older/ wee bit younger than him I think maybe you're a wee bit younger Younger Than him so ah but he would know you obviously from there and from being at school and would know that Neil would say that over that weekend that he had been in contact with you so do you want to tell us on Sunday if Neil was in contact with you?

BROWN  No comment.  

Says her mummy works there and had finished at 1800 hours ahm ah when she anived her mummy was sitting at the bar. Says that Neil Ogle came in alun ah she said didn't speak to him following a family fallout -are you aware of the family fallout or what that's about?

Says maybe an hour or so later the door burst open ah I was still sitting at the bar and ah glanced around to see Mark Sewell came in and comes straight up to me. I would know Mark Sewell to say hello to for approximately the last 10 years. Do you !mow Mark? 
No comment. Is he a friend of yours? No comment. So are you aware of this this here that's happened? No comment. Ahm And this is the point where we're saying you've driven your car

And the others in the car did you pick them up or did you pick them up after you leave? 
BROWN No comment. 
She says ahm ah we live in a small area and I would see him about ah the odd time in the Com1 Club and Albert Bar ah he come up to me and shouted, "You're fucking getting put out of the country you and your family." Are you aware of that? 
And for your own benefit then as we go through the the later interviews we're we're saying this is about quaiier past nine OK at night so it's between the assault and the murder OK. 
So there seems to be the assault then there seems to be this picking up of people you taking these people to the Albert Bar and there seems to be then this altercation so do do you want to comment on that cause obviously it's you know I know what you've said to us that you want to clear your name and stuff but obviously as we put more and more to you do you want to tell us anything about your reason why you were there, why you picked those 

Why you took them to the Albert Bar and what led to all of this how did this all come about No comment. This remark saying you know you're getting out of the country? BROWN No comment. Did you know about this? BRO\VN No comment.

BROWN No comment. 
Says I think he also said something about 24 honrs. I asked him what was going on he said Neil, Neil Ogle is lying in a pool of blood and you got him ah set up or words to that effect. So obviously at that stage Mark Sewell knows that Neil's lying in a pool of blood and he's been assaulted so I can only assume that ifyou've brought Neil to the bar that you know that as well. 
BROWN No comment. 
C \ 
Now obviously if I've got that wrong it's you know you should tell me that. 
BROWN 
No. 
Or is that right is that the way it happened? 
No comment.
BROWN 
SOLICITOR SOLICITOR  He shouted at me to get out of the bar now and then he stormed back out ah the door I stayed sitting at the bar and asked my mum Hetty to go out and see ah what it was all about. A couple of minutes later she came back in to the bar and said that Mark Sewell had threatened her as well and told her she was getting put out ofthe honse too. Mummy said ah he got in to a black or dark coloured car, which is obviously your car cause you can see on the CCTV ah your car coming yous all getting out and obviously yous getting back in again and obviously Lisa is telling us that you you got or that he got back in to a dark coloured car. See the way you say yous all get out who who who else was That's what that's what I'm asking who else was there. No but you say yous so Yeah

BROWN No comment. 
Was Mark aware about this assault before you picked him up? 
BROWN No comment. 
Now anybody else anybody else involved that you want to saywho rang or who arranged this? 
BROWN No comment. 
OK so this is obviously Hetty's ah statement she'd say Ian Ogle ah is my daughter's paiiner's brother ahm that ah she was working on Sunday she works in the Albe1i Bar on the Albe1ibridge Road and I'm assuming you must drink there because whenever I spoke to Jill she had said that she had picked you up from ahm the Albe1i Bar earlier on to get the Chinese would that be right? 
BROWN No cmrunent. 
And then obviously you're back then here in the Albert so I'm assuming that you do frequent there and you probably do know Hetty would that be the case? 
BROWN No comment. 
BROWN 
So they work in the Albeit Bar on the Albertbridge Road on Sunday the 2?'11 of January alnn I was working ah from I pm to 6pm ah she said I'd finished work at six and was sitting at the bar counter on her own having a drink ahm until Lisa came round and obviously we've heard then that Lisa did come round. Said around nine ah pm the door of the bar flew open it was really loud I was sitting with ah my back to the door. Lisa was sitting side wards ah to the to the door I turned around and saw Mark Sewell bounce in through the door. I have known Mark Sewell ah for ah mayhe 20 years as he used to be a doonnan in the Albert Bar. Ahm is that a case do you remember, do you know ifhe was a doorman?

She says he was all in dark clothing he was wearing a dark ah

wearing, can you tell me? 
BROWN No comment. 
Says he came straight over to Lisa and up in to her face shouting he said something like it's all your fault he's lyingdown there in a pool of blood ahm to Lisa so obviously for some reason you know you're there with Mark and there seems to be some reason that ah Lisa is involved or knows about Neil can you tell me about that? 
'\BROWN No. 
Is that no cause you don't know or? 
Don't know. No comment. 
BROWN He didn't say ah who he was talking about and we didn't know who or what he was talking about he said, "You've 24 hours to get out you and your fucking family", he was really really mad really angry. This all happened in less than a minute and he turned on his heels and left the bar which is if once we get the CCTV you can see obviously he's leaving the bar. Lisa told me to get out and see what it was about. I went out of the bar after him. When I went out of the bar I seen Mark down ah to my left about to get in to ah a biggish black car which was parked on the Albe1ib1idge Road facing in the direction of the Newtownards Road. I said, "Mark what's going on what's this 
all about?" Do you, do were you there when all that had happened? 
BROWN No, no comment. 
Did you hear Hetty say this to him? 
BROWN No comment. 
Cause obviously I'm sure that was he's saying you know you've time to gel out you 24 hours to get out and she's asking him what it's about. Did you say anything about why this had happened or did yoL1 speak to Hetty al all?

Page 14 of20 At this point he had turned ah towards me and moved awayfrom the car a bit ah in my direction. He said I've been a friend of yours for years but you're out alun you're out too. When he was saying this I was standing ah with my hand out open but he was pointing his finger at me. He was aggressive and shouting and I was scared. When Mark was shouting at me I saw Johnny Brown at the driver's side of the black car. At some point he must have moved towards the bla, the back of the car closer to me ah as I could see that he was wearing the same clothes as he had been wearing earlier that day. He was wearing a light grey, so I'm assuming this is you she's talking about then, he's wearing a light grey ah shorts like sweatshirt material and light grey hoody ah with sho1t sleeves. That what you were wearing? 
( 
;BROWN No comment. 
And is there any reason why she would lie about what you were wearing? 
No comment. 
BROWN He then moved towards the front of the car and got in to the driver's ah side front door. So I think that's pretty sure that you were driving then. Ah he didn't say anything to myself or or Mark. I think the car ah has four doors. I know Johnny Brown for about 10 years just from coming in and out of the bar. Is after Mark shouted and pointed at me he went back to the black car ah that Johnny Brown had got in to ah the driver's scat of. Mark got in to the front passenger side. Says ah Lisa and I were afraid of Mark coming back again and 1 said we had to get out of the bar. I got ahm smTy it's someone else writing you have to bear with me. I've got is that Owen oh Owen who's Owen? 
Yeah.

I got Owen to let us out the back ah of the Albert Bar that looks ah leads to the side street ah that the bar is on the Conn Bar is on. Ah Lisa was on the phone Lisa was crying in an awful state ah she told me that Neil Ogle had got a beating and that she thought that Mark Sewell had thought that she had got him beat up. So that seems to be ahm really the the reason ah do you want to tell me anything about all of that how that all came about? So there seems to be some reason that ahm they seem to think that Lisa's involved in some way ahm with this altercation with Neil can you enlighten me anyway about it?  

BROWN  No cmrnnent.  

So ahm the that's where we are at that stage this is is ahm we say that is in between the assault on Neil and the murder of Ian OK yous have gone to the the the the Albe1i Bar Mark Sewell seems to be very het up he's shouting he's very cross ahm with alnn obviously Lisa told her told them that they have to get out yous then get out ah come out of alnn the bar and in to the car and we're happy enough obviously people are saying that  

you're driving Mark gets in to the passenger seat so we're pretty happy and confident that yous are both in that black ah Leon at that time so who was the other people in the car?

That car then leaves and goes down the Newtownards Road and ends up in Langtree Court and that is just before the murder so it seems to be it doesn't seem to be a particularly well planned ah incident you know to plan the murder ah Jonathan it seems to be just very yeah everybody's tensions are high you know you go to the bar take Mark Sewell down this altercation with Lisa it all just seems to be a very ill planned murder.

before you make any comment on this? 
No comment. 
Cause obviously the difficulty with that is is that you know then you make up something to fit the evidence that we have put to you and it doesn't allow us to check the veracity of your own account you know of what you're actually saying because if we put absolutely everything to you it's giving you an opportunity then to try and make things fit and to be honest you're better telling the truth rather than trying to make a story fit because any story then can be checked out does that make sense? Alnn so do do you want to talk to us before we move on do you want to tell us your involvement what happened?

At the last interview then ahm obviously we had got to the Albert Bar and we'd talked about ahm the car and I'll just show you that photograph obviously that's Jill's car ah JCs or smTyJGZ 7406 so that's the car ahm that you were in and the last one I'd sort of showed you aye you were definitely driving the vehicle and we're we're all content with that and the vehicle then ends up obviously in Langtree Court ahm which is, sorry just bear with me a wee second I'll just get that, yeah, Langtree Cou1i there just offnTemplemore Avenue so that's that's where we were ahm at at the end of the the last interview so we're going to move on just slightly from there then obviously ahm the car at this stage then is in Langtree and what we believe is then that obviously there was there was four ahm people at the car at the Albert and possibly one other one in the car or you've picked some other one up we're not really sure and as I say you won't tell us this you know the scenmio of how that happened so suffice to say Langtree Court you're there and Cluan Place as we pointed out before is just down a bit Templemore Avenue and then tight onto the Albertbidge Road in to Cluan Place and that's where Ian Ogle lives and where Ian Ogle was murdered OK. So first statement that we want to ahm read out is really just the pastor there was a pastor who was with ahrn Ian at the time of his death and I'm just going to read to you what the pastor's saying. Says on Sunday the 27'11 of January 2019 at approximately 9pm I entered Cluan Place ahm just as we entered Cluan Place I'd met Ian Ogle, his nickname is Oggie.Would you know him as that? 
No comment.

I stopped shook his hand and spoke to him we just ah waved and went on to go, sorry I'm sorry I'm just somebody's writing, May just waved and went to go on to her car. We stood chatting for alun at the mouth of the junction of Cluan Place with the Albertbridge Road ah we spoke for about a good 10 minutes or so. He was in an agitated state alnn not out of control but I knew there had been some smi of altercation including his son or daughter with a local group ah with the UVF. Ian didn't mention them by name but I have always suspected that was the group he was ah having difficulties with. Are you pmi of the UVF Jonathan?

Ian ah was UVF himself ah but he considered himself old school, he disagreed with drugs he told me so before he was ahm before he was sorry oh he was very anti them. This may have been a a cause of the fallout. Ah aware of any drugs or if there was any issues with drugs?  
BROWN  No.

Ah this was the ah impression I got from him that it may have led to to and to his family falling out with them. Ah he was standing ah out concerned because there had been an incident with either his son or daughter this this evening about 10 minutes before we met. I think he was there trying to protect his family. I think he may have said they're on their way. So do do do you know anything about that before hand how Ian would have thought that there was people coming or? 
No.
BROWN Any knowledge of any of that about an arrangement being made to to go and get Ian? 
' 
)BROWN No. 
Ah I got the sense of impending doom. We also spoke about god Ian wasn't pali of our congregation but I've known him for a number of years they were very welcoming to our home to their home. I held his hand and we prayed together on the street. 
BROWN  Did you see the pastor and Ian praying together  
No comment. Just just prior to to the attack? No comment. I then became aware of a group of aboul five people they all had heads and scarves up ah except one who had a partial beard his face was exposed. He had shmi hair I believe his hair was brown his beard was perhaps five day's stubble, he had  
BROWN  

sideburns ah they were coming from the Temple Road direction 
ahrn so ah you've a bit of stubble yourself is that you that he's 
talking about Jonathan? 
BROWN No, I don't know ah. Uhm? BROWN No.

Person Interviewed: BROWN,JONATHAN DAVID HARRY  Form MG15(T)  
Alun cause he said he'd brown hair which you sort of dark brown hair you would say and alun a beard that was perhapsfive days stubble. I don't know how long it takes you to grow a beard obviously you've been away and would would on Sunday would you have had a a beard that was about five days?  Page 6 of20  
BROWN  No.  
And sideburns but yours sort of comes in to a full beard that the way you've always worn it or?  
BROWN  No.  
(  ) BROWN  No? what way do you nonnally wear that? No comment.  

Ah is that a beard that you've just grown while you're away .yeah? So you would would you have been clean shaven then on Sunday? 
My advice at this stage is just to remain answer no comment but it is your choice but additionally there's ID procedures which I'm sure police will be trying to that they'll carry out anywaywith this pastor so just. 
SOLICITOR So do you want to make any comment about that ah about your beard whether you didn't have one on Sunday 
No comment. 
BROWN 
Cause obviously he's saying a beard and if you didn't have one then uhm say well I didn't have one. 
BROWN  No comment.  
Ahm I realised something more sinister was happening they were walking with purpose. As they passed ah the red post box about 15 yards from me I thought they looked very menacing. As they started ah to move more, sorry, as they started to move more Rapidly

BROWN ��, BROWN  Rapidly towards him he moved towards them they came in to contact together. So I think that's just as they are coming close ah Ian's moving towards them I think that's the way that's ah saying it. They came in to contact at each other ahm at the pavement on the side of Cluan Place. The pavement ah nearer to our building. I can only describe ah the men as weating dark scarves well up oh over their faces ah between their heads up coveting their faces scarves up over the btidge of their noses you couldn't see their faces. Did you have a scarf over yourface? No c01mnent. Or did you have anything to disguise yourself on Sunday? No c01mnent. Ah the man with the beard looked older I got the impression he was in charge he looked intent and emotionless. I don't !mow why I think he was in charge ah but I do feel that he kept his gaze finnly as they were ah as and firmly as what they were doing. Was that you or was that  
BROWN BROWN  No comment. Mark Sewell? No comment.  

. 
BROWN 
BROWN 
Or anybody else that you were with on Sunday? No comment. Again it's your, your car and the beard is it you are you in 
charge of this? No comment. Initially I thought it was a pm1ishment beating. Is that how it started out was it just to be a bit of a beating and then it's all gone a bit crazy?

I said that's enough, this is the pastor, says that's enough stopdon't stamp on his head any more, don't stamp on his head or words to that effect, effect he did then stop he didn't look at me just walked briskly off after the others. Did you hear that?

BROWN  No comment.  
Says I didn't notice what direction the attackers went ah he was groaning a low growl he wasn't breathing I thought he was ah lying as if in the recovery position. I won-ied if his neck was broken having been stamped on. I lay my hands on his belly and prayed he let out a couple of groans his son Ryan arrived ah he was distressed at the sight of his dad. Ryan was trying to get a response from his dad and was talking to him. There was poolof blood beside him ah but not a heavy flow from anywhere there seemed to be a number of punctnre wounds. l noticed his eyes were half open and glazed I thought he was gone but hoped that he was just knocked out. His family were around and  

BROWN 

2006/07(1) 
were all hysterical it was a terrible scene. As I said I didn't see where the gang went ah to but I believe they went back in the direction from which they came. So that's the pastor who's with him and he obviously sees ahrn the attack sees him go down sees them holding him sees someone corning back and stampingon his head -were you part ofthat group? 
No comment.

BROWN BROWN  Cause obviously that's that's quite a scene you know for for a pastor to have to witness that alun you know and as I've said to you before Jonathan if it wasn't you who was it? No response. Cause it is it's it's a heck of a thing for somebody to be murdered on the street and obviously if you weren't the person who murdered them that's a hell of a thing to to have to live with you know and ah and I know you've said look I want to come back I want to you know clear my name anything that you want to say about that?

him. When this male reached the comer of Langtree Court he stopped and I then noticed a second male coming from the same direction as the on the same 
On the same 
Footpath. I will describe this male as male two. So basicallythere's two males male one and male two ahm corning towards Langtree. Ah this male was slightly shorter than the first at around five foot five to five foot seven. What height are youJonathan?

BROWN  Or was that not the intention to take it that far with weapons and somebody else has just brought those? No comment.  
OK  

I only noticed the knife when he ah joined male number one at the junction of Langtree. The knife was shining in the light ah with a metal coloured blade which looked to be around eight inches in length ah with a straight edge. The that's obviously quite big ah eight inches is quite a length of a knife so if there was a knife there I'm sure you would have noticed it if it was anything of that size and that would like to take something of eight inches would you'd nearly think that was intentional you know if you're taking a knife of that size. Did you do that did you take the knife?  

BROWN  No comment.  


Or anybody else? 
BROWN No comment. 
Ah so eight inch in length so it's a straight edge alun on one side and curved on the other side which appeared to have ah indentations on the edged surfaces. Male number two turned around to face Albe1iblidge Road and then looked and saw a further tlu�ee males who were walking on the same footpath towards male one and two. So it looks as if there's male one and two there and then another three males coming towards ahm which one were you? 

BROWN  


No comment. 
Ah male one male one and two waited ah waited off alongTcmplemore sorry walked off along Templemore Avenue and up Madrid Street and out of sight. So was the five of you there and then two of them have walked up towards Madrid Street and only three gets back in the car?

And then we can show you obviously on the map where we were talking about but you you know the area quite well obviously OK. Langtree Comi opposite the swimming baths.  
This is obviously a witness is standing just at the baths and this is what he sees there's obviously the two males one with a knife and then the three males and then male one and two walk off ahm towards Madrid Street .was that you did you walk off towards Madrid Street?  

BROWN  No comment.  

Cause obviously we know you're driving the car initially so did you continue to drive the car or did you give the keys to somebody else to drive?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Ah and out of sight. I would estimate that I watched ah male one and two for around ah 30 seconds in total ahm the group of three males didn't appear to be in any any huny. I watched them as they calmly walked in to Langtree Comi and all three got into the car that was that was parked facing into the cul-de.sac of Langtree Court, the car started up it was parked on the double yellow lines along the side of the church hall.

Facing Templemore Avenue and not facing ah into the court so it's facing towards Templemore Avenue and not facing towards into the Langtree Cami. At no time ahm were the second groupof three standing with male one and two and it was clear ah that, son-y, but it was clear that they ahm were associated together. So male one, two three other males came in they're not really together but it he has the feeling then that they're all part of the one group. Ah this was just ah before the car drove off. I got the registration number of the car which she repeatedah which is JGZ 7406 which is obviously Jill's car which is in that photograph that we're showing you there photograph one so. Ah I could see the car ah ah be ahm son-y, I could see the car as being a fresh looking five door Seat. So that's a witness ahm basically Jonathan sees the car so we we're sort of moved then from obviously the Albert the four people ah that we know on the CCTV get into the vehicle whether there's another one there or whether you pick another one up you're the driver yougo to Langtree, described how the murder had taken place from ahm the pastor who was with Ian at the time and then obviously coming back there seems to be male one and two and then a group of three but the five all seem to be part of the one groupand there's only three get in to this car again and the other two seem to go towards Madrid Street. So that that's that's the scenario that is coming out from what other people are saying so who obviously you if you're the driver ahm of the vehicle whenever it's leaving after the murder who's the other two in the car? 
No comment.

BROWN 
Yip Your solicitor. 
BROWN 
Yip. Anything you want to say? SOLICITOR 
Yeah ahm I'm going to read the following out on on behalf of Jonathan and the following is as follows. I, Jonathan Brown, DOB 7.8.85 hereby instrnct and authorise my solicitor to read this statement to police
' 
during my police interview recording my allegedinvolvement in the murder of Ian Ogle. I did not murder Ian Ogle. I did not know that a person in the Seat Leon, JGZ 7406, had a knife nor did anyone have a baton. I was asked to drive people to Cluan Place for a fight. I did not travel with the connnon purpose of committing murder. I did not plan to commit any murder with any people. I was of the beliefn! was driving these people to Cluan Place for a fight. When I arrived in the car to Langtree Place all the passengers got out. I parked the car. I walked in to Cluan Place after I parked the car when I arrived the person was stabbing Ian Ogle. Ian was hunched over I pulled this person away I told this person to, "Fuck off', I told him to stay away. I was annoyed and distressed from what I witnessed. The person and another male from the car made offon foot to Madrid Street. I understand police will want me to name people I feel thal due to fear of violence against my family I cannot name people. My parents, girlftiend and children live 111 East Belfast, mygrandparents live in East Belfast they will be attacked if I name names. This is a very difficult position I am in. I repeat that I did not murder Ian Ogle I was unaware that he would be attacked with a knife and baton and signed J Brown it's dated today and the time is at 15.25 now that's 
a copy you can do whatever exhibit. 
OK ah I'll just exhibit that as AMcV20. 
SOLICITOR Ahm Ian just provided those instrnctions but I think he he wants to mticulate something in in person before he reverts back to to no comment. If you want to just tell these people. 
BROWN 
Ahm I just I can't name names just for my own family's sake with being anyway attacked any other way of

SOLICITOR  anything else happening to them. In in in the circumstances due to instructions that he he's given me for fear ofreprisals I've advised him to continue with his with his no comment. OK ah thank you for that Jonathan ahm obviously we we we'd talked about you giving ahm your account and alun as I say you have given that account from police point of view it's very brief OK ahm so what we'd need to do is to break it down we need to establish quite a few things from that. Now I understand what you're saying about naming people and stuff but I's, I would still have to ask youquestions you know in case you've changed your mind or there's anything that you want to say ahm so we're going to take it just back OK ahm take it back to Sunday evening and alun obviously ah ah I can see that you say that yes you were there and that ahm the car and we've we've talked about the car and obviously all of that has been established that you were driving the car and certainly at the Albert Bar and we we'd talked about all that in the last interviews so talk to me a wee bit about Sunday alun what happened on Sunday?  
BROWN  I can just no comment this here?  
SOLICITOR  Yeah, yes that's (inaudible)  
BROWN  It's no conunent at all, I'm not  
SOLICITOR  The the aiun in fairness DC Mc Veigh just does have to go through the procedure but I you know I think I think it's suitable for you to no comment I think but she is still going to continue asking answer ask you questions alright.  
BROWN  Yeah that's no problem.  
Ah and I know that's probably frustrating for youJonathan but obviously ahm ah it's a brief account that you have given you know we need to know who rang who you know all of that and how this all came about and the arrangements of it ahm ce1iainly ahm if you want to tell us all of that ah and I I get that you've you've said you don't want to name the people obviously from police point of view you 're the one sitting here you know the this is what you're saying but we're saying that you were there and  

you're the one sitting here and we're saying that you're involved in this murder and I get that you have said that you didn't do that so if we just take it back maybe just to Sunday evening and I I still need to ask you questions and you !mow it's it's it's just to elaborate really on what you have said. So can you tell me what happened on Sundayevening? 
BROWN  No comment.  
OK ahm obviously you've ended up ahm with Jill's car

quite emotive you know cause ah he's a pastor and he's obviously witnessing somebody being murdered. Did you see him there?  
BROWN  No comment.

Page 8 of34 
BROWN  Jonathan and you've said ah ah when I an-ived a personwas stabbing Ian Ogle does that mean you anived after the person? Yip.  
So you're saying that whenever ahm has there been a few have gone before, how many had went before you get to Cluan Place?  
BROWN  No comment. Cause obviously you're saying you arrive and somebody's stabbing not that yous are all there together and this happens cause from the pastor's statement the pastorwould say that there was about five there you know at the one time I think ah  
Hyenas holding his anns  
/  Yeah you !mow they sort of jumped on him like hyenas so it looks like the five people ahm you know all at once so it doesn't look as if you know somebody's there the stabbing takes place and then you come from the independent person the pastor saying that. Is that a lie?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Is that not true is it is it is it truth that you were there when the stabbing was taking place?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Cause ah I I can understand that that sort of takes youaway from it you know I just went I was to drive people there was to be a fight I amve and everybody is and he's being stabbed and I ah I can see that that takes you trying to take yourself away from it all but from what the pastor's saying that ce1iainly doesn't seem to be the case.  
Cause again if you're the getaway driver why wouldn't you just stay in the car, why did you get out of the car? -..- 

BROWN No comment. 
And you're saying then you pulled a person off are youyou aware then that Ian was dead at that stage? 
BROWN No connnent. 
Or did you, many times did you see this person stabbing? 
BROWN  No c01rnnent.  
And then you said that you pulled him away OK what  
happened at that stage?  
BROWN  No comment.  
What did you do to pull him away?  
BROWN  No comment.  


Did you say anything to him? 
BROWN Just shouted at him. 
What did you shout? 
BROWN Fuck off.

OK and what did he do? 
BROWN No comment. So cause obviously ah the pastor doesn't mention any of that you know he what he would say somebody comes back and stamps on his head did you see that? 


BROWN No,nno. Had you gone by that stage? 


BROWN No comment. So you pull this person off off Ian ahm the person who's stabbing him and then you tell him to fuck off did anybody else say anything? 


BROWN No comment. And who was the person with the knife who was doing the stabbing? 


.BROWN No comment. 

) So and you'd said Ian was hunched over and you pulled this person away and you tell them to fuck off ahm anything anybody else do anything or anybody try to assist you in it? 

BROWN No comment. And did the others know that this this you know that people had knives were you did anybody mention anything and say oh such in a such has got a knife? 


BROWN No comment. Ah before you know yous go to Cluan Place? BROWN No comment. Any chat about it at all? 




BROWN No cmmnent. Or did you say to anybody listen any weapons leave them in the car anything like that? 


BROWN No comment. 
Can can you desc1ibe the knife to us? 
BROWN No comment. Ah it's still outstanding anything to assist us in trying to locate it, it's description? 
BROWN No comment. Cause that would obviously help us ah 
BROWN No Jonathan yon know if we find the knife find somebody's fingerprints and then we can say well maybe what Jonathan's saymg 1s right you know that ah there's nothing to link Jonathan to this knife you know there's his fingerprints aren't on it such in a such's fingcrp1ints are on it and it's about you helping yourself so if you can assist us it's going to help you.

Page 10 of34 
Ah to be honest I'm not sure you have Jonathan I I  
appreciate you you have given us something but it's it is  
very little.  
BROWN  That's that's all I can say.  
Tell me about the the guy when he's doing the stabbing 
de, describe to me exactly what that person does.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Which hand was it the knife in?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Where did he stab him?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Where did you see him being stabbed?  
BROWN  No c01mnent.  
Can youjust put yourself back there and  
'BROWN  No, not really.  
And say tell me where you're standing at that stage.  
BROWN  No comment.  
And what you see.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Cause obviously if you're saying that I've come in this  
guy's stabbing this person what what what is it exactly 
that you see?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Was Ian on the ground?  
BROWN  No comment.  
Or was he standing up at that stage?  
BROWN  No comment.  
And by the time you see the stabbing do you know how  
many stab wounds there was at that time?  
BROWN  No c01mnent. --"-------.---.--<--------��--.-___ ,, --. 
SOLICITOR  Can can I just intervene just slightly at this stage ahm it  
there's a number of people just that to ensure that he he  
he's he feels safe with what what's going on here alnn  
he's maintaining his no comment because there there's a  
number of people, number of people on police hail here  
and and what he is concerned about ah is this. If he stmis  
talking to you like this to say this is what's going on that  
inevitably will he used against another person cause we  
we do hope that police locate the stabber OK so what he is  
won-ied about cause we've consulted about this is cause  
you've told him well Jill says this in her interview so he  
has no assurance whatsoever that police then speak to  
mister such in such and say well we put it to you you're  
the stabber mister such in such and by the way Mr Brown  
says that you were over him and you you were stabbing  
away cause this increases the risk against him and and his

family.  
I unders  
SOLICITOR  So ah that's that's a concern it it it I know you're doing  
your role and it's you're you know I'm not not definitely  
not  
BROWN  I mean  
SOLICITOR  being critical but I just have concerns then if he starts to  
elaborate there it's going to be used against them.  
But he's not elaborate you're not elaborating in other  
points you know OK yes you have just said you don't  
want to name names but you're not giving us any further  
details  
BROWN  I've detailed it there what way I've seen it.  
And and listen we appreciate I appreciate you know  
,.BROWN  This is the whole point of me saying I want to clear my  
/  name I don't want to be held as a murderer-simple.  
And I understand Jonathan you know ah you are in a  
different ea, difficult position because of the personalities  
that are involved in this  
BROWN  Know  
And ahm ah that that is but even without actually totally  
naming them you could still tell us the whole scenario of  
you know what has happened and what you've observed  
and what you have seen you know at this stage you're not  
actually telling us you know who who these  
Yes  
People are but you could tell us you know I received a  
phone call  
A phone call  
I was told to do this  
�.  I was told to pick up  
I was you know  
Or whatever happened.  
You know so it's just about elaborating on the pe1iphery if  
you like you !mow without actually saying these this is the  
personalities are that involved because ah as I'd said to  
you the our difficulty is you are there we know you're  
there but we only have your word that you didn't do the  
stabbing do you know  
BROWN  That's  
That's that's all we have without anything else.  

SOLICITOR  Can can I and I'd ahm appreciate we're we're really not litigating the matter but I respectfully say the witness at at the baths would say that that he's not the stabber cause the witness at the baths says that that the man with the knife heads off towards Madrid Street and three other  
2006/07(1)  

t�1@@Mf-1! 
Person Interviewed: BROWN,JONATHAN DAVID HARRY Fonn MGI5(T) Page 12 of34 
individuals/persons/people whatever move back towards  
the JGZ so I would respectfully say that if we're taking  
the witness at the baths, ah I don't think you disclosed the  
name and I'm I don't want you to, ahm but the witness at  
the baths points away from him  
Uhm  
SOLICITOR  being the stabber.  
But what the difficulty with that is ahm Jonathan to be  
honest is a knife can be passed around anybody you know  
that could have been someone has stabbed him, passed the  
knife to this person for this person to walk off towards  
Madrid Street to get rid of it you know so that I you know  
we can't say that. That person doesn't say that was  
Jonathan Brown was in the driver's seat anybody can  
drive a car you know anybody can sit in any seat of the car  
anybody can move so we can't you know categorically  
say the person that had the knife at that stage was the  
person that done the stabbing so that's that's wh, that's  
where we are and as I say without you elaborating on  
some of the other as I say even I I get it you know about  
you know you your family and your worries and your  
concerns and all of that but even to you know fill us out  
on all of the rest of it really paint a picture of exactly  
SOLICITOR  Ah is it not the police case  
What had happened.  
SOLICITOR  that he drives it back to Pitt Place though cause you've  
your case earlier on today was that he drives the car back  
to Pitt Place.  
Yes we we believe that he but you know  
SOLICITOR  So he he wasn't the person that went to Madrid Street  
then.  
But to be honest people can stop cars they can start you 
know people  
Ch, change drivers.  
Can change anything's possible any absolutely anything  
SOLICITOR  Aw I appreciate you're covering  
Is possible.  
SOLICITOR  I think you're coveiing and I appreciate you're covering  
all bases but that's  
Well I  
SOLICITOR  he says he's not the stabber  
Well ah yeah and and listen Jonathan I I I can't just take  
you at face value for that  

BROWN  That's fair enough  
You know  
BROWN  I'm that's what I've said and that's what I'm sticking to.

BROWN  And did they still have the knife? Well you stated they still the knife whenever they left the car.  
Can you confinn that?  
BROWN SOLICITOR  Yeah Now what you need to be advised is you've ah just just so you know, is you you're concerned about reprisals against your family there may well be CCTV we hope potentially but just if you 're concerned about giving too much information about what another person done -do you get me?

Page 2 of6 do say anything it may be given in evidence and obviously we've explained what that had meant. Em just Jonathan in the last interview then we, you had given us a pre-prepared statement and we had eh gone through that statement and em but we had being gone through witness statements and things like that in the previous interview so I've another statement here just to put to you em so that's what we're going to do now. Okay this is a statement from someone who was on the Albertbridge Road at em at a phone box and observed basically what had gone on. So says on the 27111 of January 2019 I was workingin Ballyhackamore where I'm employed em I left work at 8 pm. A fiiend collected me from work and dropped me off at McDonald's, Connswater. From McDonald's I walked home. I was home for around eh I O minutes when I decided to ring my mother. I have no em credit on my mobile phone so I decided to use the public pay phone. The pay phone is just outside eh the front door of Keen's, I don't know the name of the road but it rnns from eh Central Station to Connswater eh walking to the phone box there was eh no one else about except for two persons standing at the Glider stop that I had eh to walk past. I would add that I was walking eh to the public phone box in the same side em as the phone box and before I got to the Glider stop there were two men both aged 3 5 to 40 years, they were standing talking. Did you notice anybody em. 
BROWN No comment. It says eh I nodded to them as I walked past and the one in the blue t.shiti eh nodded back. I did not recognise them whilst I was in the telephone box. I observed a group of 5 or 6 males, they appeared to be wa, wearing hoodies, they came from the road which rnns down the side ofKeen's, none of them would have been eh more than 5 foot 8 in height. As they eh came towards the telephone box they picked up pace. One, once the past me em their pace really quickened up. I looked out of the telephone box em I would be looking roughly in the 
' direction of Central Station eh one of the males was carrying a knife in his back pocket. I could see the blade. The knife handle was in his pocket with the lmife protrnding. So there, there's just, the, the guy obviously has the knife amm pre, you know it's smi of sticking out his back pocket. Now from em what we can see I believe that youwould've been behind this male with the knife and obviously if this guy can see this knife sticking out of his back pocket from across the road, I've no doubt Jonathan that you would've seen it if you were behind him and you would've been well aware that there was a knife being carried there. Because obviously it's sticking out it's, it's quite a large knife as we'd said before and this guy will go on to describe it but obviously it's quite a large knife and you !mow you must've seen that sticking out of his pocket and you must've been aware that it was there because if you're behind this guy you must be aware of that. And I know you said from your pre-prepared statement that you, youweren't aware that anybody was carrying weapons. 
BROWN Definitely wasn't.

Page 3 of6 
But I have to suggest that you, you were aware.  
BROWN  (Inaudible).  
And did you see this knife.  
BROWN  No definitely not.  
\  I would say that the make of the knife was em Global and it had a 7 to 9 inch blade so quite substantial. I think this guy knows, think he does a bit of chefing and stuff and knows sort of knives and what they look like so that's how he would desctibe it. Em these men started running towards the two men. As they approached them eh they produced eh what I call batons, so I think the two men that he's initially em desc1ibing is obviously Ian and the pastor and then he, he sees the 5 coming along, one of them with obviously a large knife in his back pocket and then the 5 people are running towards the two men which we believe is Ian and the pastor. As they em approached them they produced what I call, I would call batons, these were pieces of wood or metal, I can't say which nor can I say where they eh produced them from. These men attacked the man in the blue t-shiti, was Ian wearing a blue t-shirt.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Ah they gave him a good hammering. So basically he's saying everybody's together so the difficulty with that Jonathan is obviously you're saying that you come along afterwards. Em he's saying that all 5 are all together, there's no like a straggler that you're coming and noticing this stabbing afterwards and the pastor would also say that they all jumped on him like hyenas so from two eye witnesses they're saying that all the 5 are together not that you've come along later as you say in your statement. Difficulty with that obviously Jonathan is that it looks like that you're trying to distance yourself from that but from what independent witnesses are saying that doesn't appear to be the case.  
ROLICITOR . f..'-.  Do, does the pastor, does this guy says everyone has weapons doesn't he . Doesn't say everyone.  
SOLICITOR  (Inaudible).  

 He's saying that he notices em obviously the blade and then he, what he has said is em that there pieces of wood and metal what he would call batons, he can't say nor can he say where they were produced from so seems to be more than one implement like either pieces of wood or batons or em that's what he's saying. These men attacked the man in the blue t-shi1i, they give him a good hammering eh for what I reckon was less than two minutes. So it's obviously em quite a shmi attack and I think that's em we've sort of established that anyway you know that's it's, it's quite quick, it's not, it's not something that em you know somebody's gone on in to just do a fight like you've saying we'll go for a fight and everybody's fighting and then it gets a bit out of hand and then somebody decides to stab you know maybe red mist  

comes down, somebody decides to stab. What it looks like is they've 
2006/07(1) 
t�)@@Mffl! 
Person Interviewed: BROWN,JONATHAN DAVID HARRY Fann MG l 5(T) 
Page 4 of6 
gone in with the intent to beat him with either batons and then stab him cause it's really a very quick attack and he's stabbed right away. Em he reckons it was less than two minutes. Eh the man in the blue t-shirt was kicked and punched to the ground and hit with batons. Did you hit him with any batons or any implements. 
BROWN 
No comment. How many batons were there then. BROWN 
No comment. He says I did not see him being stabbed but what I can tell you is he was stabbed at least 11 times. Now that is quite substantial you know so that's, in such a short time that's just like stab, stab, stab you know and that's just in a short time. And certainly from, from this statement as well as the pastor's, doesn't seem to be any indication somebody's trying to pull him off or somebody's you know stabbing him and 
somebody's trying to remove him and so it, it doesn't, it doesn't add up with what yon 're saying Jonathan. 
BKOWN 
I'm, I'm telling you what I've done so that's, that's it. But you can see where police are corning from, you know we. BROWN 
Well I can see where I'm coming from so. Yeah I, I know you can cause you can tell me you know your story but what police obviously look for is independent evidence and we have a pastor telling us one thing and we obviously have this independentwitness who's absolutely nothing to do with this telling us somethingelse and neither of those match up with what you're telling us. 
BROWN 
That's fine. So do you want to tell us the trnth of what has happened. BROWN 
That is the trnth. Well from what I say other people saying doesn't appear to be. BROWN 
That's up to you'se then to work that out cause I, I've told you the truth from my side and that's all I can say. So do you want to, do you want to elaborate or do you want to tell us actually what happened. 
-
BROWN No, no comment. 
Said did not see him being stabbed, there was no verbal exchange prior to this and the man in the blue t-shiit did not try to run away. So em I say that's what, that's what he's saying no verbal exchange just goes in basically what the, the pastor's saying in like a pack of hyenas, stab him, punch him and away. 
There's no like in your pre-prepared you, you're telling us you shouted 
fuck off at the person who was doing the stabbing, neither of these people are saying they heard any shouting. 
It says the fight was finished and these men were walking back towards me. Eh the men had returned back to the way they came but running away so I say this is an independent witness saying that em what he, what he has seen and I say it doesn't seem to match up with what you're saying Jonathan, do you want.

Doesn't seem to match up with the last statement either. SOLICITOR 
It d, doesn't, I mean I don't want a debate, I mean Jonathan, Jonathan's right there, I mean this guy is bath it doesn't match up with the guy at the bath said either. 
BROWN 
Sure it says two's away on in front. This is. Yeah. This is opposite Cluan Place. Yeah th, this isn't in. 
BROWN 
That's Keen's, that's Keen's. Yeah. BROWN 
It's not even close. No this, this is a phone box across the way on the Albertbridge Road not on Templemore Avenue, it's a very cause. 
PQWN Youjust told me Keen's. 
( 
He passes Keen's. He passes Keen's he says. (Inaudible). He, he says he passes Keen's, yeah it might be worth looking at the map cause obviously he's in a phone box so he's come past Keen's, he's in a phone box and he's observing then what is happening. Yes is Keen's is obviously in the junction of Templemore Avenue and the Albertb1idge. Emmnhmm. You would agree. 
BROWN 
Yeah. Okay this phone box is on down on the Albetibridge Road near to the scene of the murder. So that's (inaudible). 
RROWN 
And, and, and they're saying they can see in that street. 
' 
Well they can see, they, what they're describing is from the phone box they can, they can see what's happening on. SOLICITOR 
I, I, I just. BROWN 
It's lies. SOLICITOR 
I just think it's a matter for ultimately the tribunal he's saying what he's saying, this guy's, know you're challenging a wee bit but he's. Yeah but, but you, you know it's obviously we have to look at what the pastor's saying and what this guy is saying and what you're saying Jonathan so. 
BROWN 
Well that's, that's, well thenjusl have a look at that that's just the way it is. And. And do remember the pastor is obviously standing right beside Ian as this happens. And there doesn't seem to be anyone saying about you coming afterwards or you know.

Page 2 of 19 do say anything it may be given in evidence. Em we've just had a series of interviews there and we've just sort of finished off Jonathan statements em so we're intending to do in this interview is to put some CCTV to you and ask you to comment on that, is that okay. Em Danny's obviously going to, to look after that pmi ofit for us. Okay this is em copy of CS6, CCTV footage from the Albertbridge Road. I'm going to let it play through okay eh and then we'll, we'll stop it and go through, I'll let it play a couple of times even just, okay (inaudible). So this. Oh sorry it's not at the start (inaudible). Okay so this is it just running through again or sorry this is it. Still, yeah. Sorry still this is. 
\ . Okay.
( 
Okay so that, that's just a nm through eh Jonathan just to give you an idea of, of that so we'll just talk you through it em now. Just let me know when you want to pause. Yeah just go ahead. So this is obviously you 'se on your way em to the murder, to commit the murder and as you'd seen there's 5 people ah come into view. Can you identify those people for me. 
BROWN No. Can you identify which one is you cause we know you, you were there. 
BROWN No comment. So there's a blue hoodie em somebody in a green top, blue jacket with a white stripe and them get a bit closer and sorry first one. So can you identify any of those to me. 
BROWN No. I. Can you identify yourself. 
L,(OWN 
No comment. We believe that guy the second guy, the guy there with the stripes is you. 
BROWN 
No comment. From, from other footage there, there would be clear footage of that being you, would you agree with that. 
BROWN 
No comment. Okay. I say police believe that that is you, who, who's that with you. BROWN 
No comment. And obviously we see you coming round and if you just pay some attention to the guy in the green (inaudible). Might've flicked over it there with. Emm hmm just go back, I'll let it play through. 
BROWN 
ls this here we're talking about the knife here. Yeah. So you've the guy in the green has a knife, you can see he's 
2006/07(1)

touching the back of his jacket. 

BROWN Sure how, how could I have seen that. You can see the flicker of light of the, of the knife and you're obviously behind him Jonathan. Right behind him. 

So there's, there's no way you couldn't. 
BROWN I'm not even looking anywhere near anybody. There's no way that you couldn't know that that guy has a knife cause you're right behind him. 


SOLICITOR I mean that, that's, it; if you put that to him, we're labouting that I don't agree with you but again me and you aren't giving evidence here so. Yes but we, we've got a, we've got a witness across the way can clearly see it so if Jonathan's tight behind him he must clearly see it. 
: And that witness did point out this boyfriend and girlfriend at the bus stop too so there's no. You know. You know. So he's a clear view, that person has a clear view. 
BROWN Where so where are you saying this is. We're saying that is you okay and the fella in the green. 
BROWN And I, and I can see through his top. No, no. No. Believe he'd the knife in the back pocket like the previous statements. 
BROWN Well I can't, I can't even see it now. Well obviously that needs to be enhanced but from eh the viewing of it police. Believe. Believe that that is certainly a knife.
L 
b!ZOWN I, I didn't see no knife that's it, I'm. The only thing is Jonathan the knife is quite a size you know it's like what somewhere between 7 and 9 inches it's been described as. That's not something that you could sit comfortably in a car with you !mow so that knife must've been out from ah because obviously he's carrying it there in the back, in his back eh pocket so that must've been out at some stage in the car because to sit with that I honestlydon't think that you could possibly sit in a car with a 7 to 9 inch knife in your back without either tipping something or cutting yourself or you know it being uncomfortable so that must've been out of his pocket so you must've seen it in the car. 

Did you. 
BROWN No. 
And I get what you're saying you know that you don't want to em saywho these other people are but at the end of the day Jonathan it's you

BROWN  sitting here answering questions. You know what loyalties do youhave to these people. No comment. You know to protect them. Cause you're the one that's here, you, you 'II end up being maybe the fall guy for this just because you won't tell us who these people are. Now we believe that one of them is Mark Sewell and the other one is Glen Rainey and yourself so which one's which. No comment. And who's the other two that are with you. No cmmnent. You know cause at the end Jonathan if you're saying that look I didn't do this you've a loyalty to yourself and your own family you know to tell us exactly what has happened. Now I'm not sure that you're being totally honest in your statement because from what we can see youknow obviously you, we believe that you can see the knife or believe the knife is probably out in the car.  
BROWN  

BROWN  
. '  
BROWN  And you can see that I don't have a knife. No but you obviously see that somebody else has so did that guy then pass that knife to anybody else or was that the guy that used the knife. I, I, I think you're, you're over egging the thing that he can see it, I mean you've put it to him a couple of times and he's saying he can't see like (inaudible).  

SOLICITOR  
Well what we're, we're saying is that it, it, we, you can say, I, I get it that this is qnite, like it's a small image.  
SOLICITOR  Emmnhmm. Emm hmm. We need to you know make that bigger but take it from us that there is em what we believe is a knife in that guy's pocket em and you're right behind him. We have two witnesses whose versions don't match up with yours and this doesn't match up with yours either because there's obviously a knife being can-ied there and you're behind him and he's in your car and we believe that he must've had that knife out of the car you know out of his pocket to be able to catTy such a substantial knife. So what I'm saying to you is all of that isn't matching up, you know you're sitting here, I don't know what your loyalty, loyalties to these people are whether they're your best friends or what it is but it's you sitting here, you know you don't want to end up the fall guy for something that you didn't do if that's, you know if that's the case. If it's the case that you're involved and you know you took the knife from that guy and you stabbed him and it all isn't as you're saying well then that's, that's the way it is and I get it that you want to protect yourself by giving the statement that you've given but it's just not matching up Jonathan to be honest. So you need to look after yourself and you need to start telling us the truth because we're keeping putting wee bits and bits to you that are all showing that it's not.

BROWN SOLICITOR h .0LICITOR  It's not changing that statement that I give you. Yeah that's fine, I, I, I, I think you've answered (inaudible). Your statement also would say that you arrive whilst Ian is beingstabbed, you an-ived separate from this group, clearly you don't. The 5 of you'se anived together and that's from CCTV as well as two witnesses so what you're telling us in your pre-prepared it's a lie, you don't an-ive after, you a1Tive in a group. So you can see where we're coming from Jonathan you know that just doesn't match up, that just didn't happen. You know you're there at the same time as the others but we need to know then exactly what, who done what and what happened at that stage that's what we need from you. Not just a general sort of statement oh I was there, I tlied to stop it but with no detail. You know you need to look after yourself and tell us exactly what happened. If you've nothing to do with this there's no issue with you telling us the absolute truth because what you've told us at the minute doesn't match up with any of this. Play on.  
And just for your own benefit I'll get the times exactly for the next interview but this is recorded at eh 2118 hours okay and yourselves going down to the, to Cluan Place okay and by 2120 you'se are coming back. So it's give or take a minute or so you'se are down at Cluan Place. So basically that's to get you from that point to Cluan Place to commit the murder and back again. As, as I said to you it's a very sh01i window you know it's not like a prolonged em something that's happened.  
So this is you'se coming back, first person running, blue.  
BROWN  Who's that. No comment.  
Did they do the stabbing.  
BROWN'  No comment. -------..------"�----�--. 
What was their role.  
I- 
BROWN  No c01mnent.  
Number 2.  
So as you can see what looks like a knife.  
BROWN  (Inaudible).  
But as I said to you before Jonathan that doesn't mean to say that he actually done the stabbing, that.  


( 
SOLICITOR Auk but like I mean you're, you're. 
SOLICITOR You, I know, no, no disrespect DC McVeigh you're trying to 1ide a couple of different horses when it comes to him here. No.

Emmnhmm. But you're the investigator.  
SOLICITOR  
Yeah. You're trying to ride a couple of different horses here. And that's why I'm asking you.  
SOLICITOR  

SOLICITOR  You are. Jonathan. Okay.  

Ifyou didn't do it.  
SOLICITOR  You can. lfyou didn't, if this guy done it.  
SOLICITOR  Continue no cmmnent. If this guy done it and he hasn't passed that knife to anybody cause to be honest what could happen there is somebody's committed that, give that to him and said cause he's running faster than the others, get rid of that. Right. 
SOLICITOR  
SOLICITOR  Is that the case. Now as an independent police investigator but I really don't want this to come off, off script here, he's going down, this man here with the knife. So you 're saying like come on Jonathan he has the knife in front of you, you surely know this is all happening and then this is a very frenzied attack Jonathan but hold in in that very quick frenzied attack that only takes two minutes the knife is passed around back to this man. And that, this is.  
Well that's happened.  
SOLICITOR  I. I'm asking (inaudible) cause to be, to be honest.  
SOLICITOR C  Come on. The bit that goes out of screen we can'( see what's happening. And again I'll remind you.  
And if it didn't happen.  
Just because you're not the person who did the stabbing does that not mean.  
SOLICITOR  We, we know that.  
The murderer.  
SOLICITOR BROWN SOLICITOR  We know that. Well that's fine. (Inaudible) we know that.  
So that's. And you're not assisting us by not identifying people.  
And that's all, sony.  
Or telling us anything about the knife.

I, and I think it's getting, it's getting very silly just for it to be passed around and come back, it is a murder investigation, no stone should be left unturned but that it's getting you're literally, it's literally 4 different horses, I wouldn't even say 3. Well I'm sure as you know as a solicitor there's nothing. 
SOLICITOR 
Yeah. Beyond the realms of possibility. SOLICITOR 
Okay. Until it can be proven that, that definitely can be the case. SOLICITOR 
That's to be. And that's why we're asking you Jonathan. SOLICITOR 
There's a thing called re. Ifit's not the case, tell us. SOLICITOR 
It's reason, it's reasonable Detective, reason, reasonable, not the 
'\ 
realms of possibility. Sure anything's, anything's reasonable. SOLICITOR 
It's not. It is, he could've went out of screen done whatever, we don't know. BROWN 
In another one of them statements it says that he's run away from into Madrid Street as well. (Inaudible). And it doesn't say exactly him so that's why we're asking you. Who. Who is that. 
BROWN 
Well it says the second male. But. BROWN 
And you just said to me there now it's the second male. That person sees two males at there and then the other 3 and yes I get what you're saying, he could, that could be those two males, I don't know whether they've waited at the end ofTemplemore Avenue sony just one wee second. 
r .0LICITOR Do you say that's, sony yeah (inaudible). I don't know whether they've waited at the end of Templemore Avenue and you've all came together and then two others branch off, I don't know because I don't know who's who and I want you to tell me who's who so as I can say well yes okay that fits that's that person and he's done that. You say to me yes he, he's male number one or two what the em what the independent witness is saying who sees them, you tell me that and then I'll go okay well then maybe that's the case but at this stage Jonathan you're telling me nothing so I just have to speculate on is that or is it not and keep asking yon and if it is the 
BROWN  case. Or what it comes down to, is the male in the green the stabber, is that what you 're telling us. No comment. You know if it is tell us, you know if he is the guy that you seen

No comment. 
At this stage. Okay then eh we're going to talk now obviously about calls that were made em on Sunday the 27th okay. I am going to refer to your phone number just for purposes as the last 3 digits okay 038 just to make that clear okay. Em as we've indicated throughout eh we believe this is ass eh all came about on that Sunday because Neil Ogle was assaulted outside Spence's chip shop and for whatever reason you've become involved in this okay. Em we believe, our enquiries to date would say Neil Ogle is assault, is assaulted outside the chip shop, half 8 to twenty to 9 approximately okay. Em I interviewed Neil himself and he said it was a prolonged you know it was about 7 minutes he would put it as, as does eh another person okay. Em following the assault and I've gone through these, this billing with Neil himself, he contacts his partner Jennifer Leahy first okay for an 8, approximately 8 minute call okay. Do you know Jennifer. 
BROWN  No comment.  
Do you know them as partners.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Have you ever met her before.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Do you know where she lives.  

BROWN 
No comment. We would believe then that Neil is making his way back to Jennifer's house em whilst telling her about the assault but what we're, we're concerned with you Jonathan is then at 2045 eh 8.45 pm just after the assault we believe eh Neil Ogle is calling yourself, okay. Did Neil Ogle call you at quarter to 9 that evening after he was assaulted. 
BROWN  No comment.  
It's a call lasting 97 seconds here, what was discussed  
during that call.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Did Neil tell you about his assault.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Did he ask you for any assistance.

girlfriend's, she didn't want to get involved, she wouldn't let him into the house you know for his, his treatment okay so she turns him away effectively. Was that him then asking you for help, for a lift.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Did you go and pick up Neil Ogle.  
BROWN  No comment.  
On the Beersbridge Road.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Okay.  
At that stage obviously you know we've talked about this Jonathan you know believe this started some way em somehow that you became aware of Neil and obviously we know now that Neil has been in contact with you and I, I can't imagine that if this assault that's only happened that you wouldn't have, you wouldn't have a discussion about that. You !mow he's obviously ringing you for some reason either tell us what the reason was ifnit isn't, if it's something other than the assault.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Cause that's, that would seem to be the pinpoint of it you know em there's been nothing then Neil 1ings you just after he's been assaulted so it looks like he's ringing you to try and get something done. So what, what is it he talks about.  
BROWN  No cmrnnent.  
Does he talk about the assault.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Or does he ask you to go and get something to get sorted with Ian and Ryan.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Are you the go to guy like are you the fixer in the area.  
BROWN  No comment.  
You know so if somebody needs something s01ted out would you be that guy to go to.  
BROWN  No comment.  
So why, why is Neil ringing you.  

BROWN No comment. Cause obviously that, that is quite significant. 
BROWN No comment. You are the second person he phones after his, his girlftiend to tell him about this assault. And it's important to clarify did Neil Ogle ask you or order you to do this. 
BROWN No comment. 
Eh 2048 hours then eh you phone eh Neil Ogle back em and the call lasting 43 seconds. Again what are you'sediscussing dming this call.

You know if, if there is an innocent explanation Jonathan you know if Ricky's just like somebody that's nothing to do  
with that, means you know if you want to tell us who Ricky is to rule him out you can do that. You know if he's  
absolutely nothing to do with this there's no harm in telling us who he is.  
BROWN  No comment.  

Or is he involved.

It's your car driving round east Belfast, is that correct.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Is that why Neil phoned you, you're the fixer, the organiser.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Cause obviously em Jonathan at that time just before the murder happens these, those, those are the people you seem to be contacting, seems to be a lot of contact between youand these guys and em nobody else so is that, is that youorganising those 4 guys to go with yourself to do the murder.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Cause there's nobody else there seems to be, I mean we know that you're in the car, we know there's 4 other people with you and they're the 4, there's 4 people there that you have been ringing and contacting. So is that the case, is that what's happened that em Neil has rang you, told you what has happened and you've got em Robert Speers, Mark Sewell eh Glen Rainey and Reece Kirkwood together to, to go down to sort Ryan and Ian out.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Or was the intention just to go, let's go and get him and

I'm going to ask at this stage em the time here the murder of Ian Ogle is registered here at 2119 hours, that would be from the CCTV em that I showed you previously. You've said in your pre-prepared you know you'se, you'se are going to do an assault, what is Neil Ogle's role in this, why do you'se all go to try and get some sort of revenge even if it is an assault against lan or his son Ryan.

that correct.

You get them altogether and then you'nse go down and do a murder. I think for, I think that's sort of the most significant that comes out of the phone records.

(Inaudible). Eh Cluan Pia or sony is it em. It'll come up here. 
Yeah I'll just wait to it comes up here sorry yeah Pitt Place so this is obviously where the vehicle em Jill's vehicle is normally parked okay and this here is what it shows, it shows you leaving then initially em Pitt Place. 
And that's the, the real time okay 2047 hours. 
Okay and I appreciate that's quite (inaudible) for you to see.

So we're concentrating up here. 
Yeah so that, that's just really at the back of Jill's house. And that's just, all that is, is really just showing you the time whenever you leave okay. Okay so the next bit then is em it just shows the vehicle then going em from Wolff Close or from Pitt Place and then it turns left onto the Newtownards Road, I'll maybe let you see it first and then we can maybe go back again and just show it as we talk throughit. 
That previous one there. 
Yeah so obviously this one is just say this is where the car was parked at Pitt Place, this is Jill's car parked and this is whenever you leave. 
(Inaudible). 
And I appreciate this is a small screen but obviously once it's on the bigger screen it'll be clearer. 
See the lights come on as if someone's pressed a button (inaudible).So there we go and up the Newtownards Road. 
Okay so that's it turning left onto the Newtownards Road. So and this, if you just want to play that and then we'll come back to it again. 
Yeah. SOLICITOR Yeah. 
And just talk through it. Okay so this, if you just want to have a wee look at the, the mop, the map here em so this is obviously you coming out then along the Newtownards Road and then the car goes to, sorry I'm looking at this upside down, so the car comes along the Newtownards Road em into Wye Street and then up Frame Street and then out of. 
Ina.

Ina Street. 
Ina, 
And then it comes back down this way and back into Wye Street, so just if you want to see that, that's just showing you what way it goes. 
Okay. Okay. This is Wye Street. Coming up to (inaudible) Street and then into turn left. Turning left at the bottom into Ina. Obviously from our research we, we would know that em Mark 
Sewell lives in Wye Street, is that correct. BROWN No comment. So is that what you were doing, is that why you were in that area, were you down picking people up. BROWN No comment. 
BROWN 
BROWN 
So obviously this is earlier on whenever cm before yon go to the bar and this is where you're going em. 
No cmmnent. In Wye Street. So do you pick Mark Sewell up there to take him to the Albert Bar. No comment. 
Okay so just want to. The, the next one is obviously of the Prince Albeit

And just let you see it and then we'll go back and we'll, we'll talk about it then. 
About two minutes long. 
Maybe I'll just say that, that's whenever the altercation you know with Hettie is happening in the bar, obviously the 4 people come out of the car into the bar and this is obviously you'se coming back out again and you !clicking on the lights.And as you know from Hettie's statement there's a bit of an altercation and this would appear to be Mark then having you know abit of a, she, she would say you know in her statement that she'd came out and this seems to be that altercation. 
> 
I 
SOLICITOR Sorry you know what it 1S a glare, that's why I'm sitting that (inaudible). 
No, no carry on. 
It's, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it is difficult. 
If you need to tilt it this eh. 
To see. So basically it's, it's, it's consistent with what em you know the two ladies in the bar say and you'se, about you'se going into the bar and em coming back out again. You' se appear to be wearing sort of same clothing that was in em whenever we showed you the CCTV footage earlier. So just here em Jonathan em obviously after you come out ofWye Street, out ofnWye Street you've ended up em coming to the em the Albert Bar, how do you get there, how do you get onto the Albertb1idge Road to the bar here. 
BROWN No comment. 
I, I know there's like a wee alleyway s01i of thing at the Great Eastern Bar, did you drive, I think it's s01i of very close to Dee Street, did you drive that way down through the alleyway and straight out into the Albe1ibridge Road.

BROWN  Or did you take another route round. No comment. I say then that, that's obviously you'se at the, the Albert eh the Prince Albert Bar em and leaving just before all of this happens. So em couple of minutes later then you'se obviously see you'se all getting back em into the vehicle and we, we've asked you sort of repeatedly who these people are and who all was in the car and, and you haven't told us that, you, you're, don't want to have to tell us that so do you want to tell us now. No and you know the reason. Or is there anything at this stage that you want to tell us. No. Okay so ahm the next bit then is just the Newtownards Road and what this shows then is the car going up eh the Newtownards Road and then it turns left into is it Belvoir Street or Belvoir Street which way the local people call it, Bclvoir is it cause I think it's the Belvoir Bar isn't it. No comment. Okay so well it goes into Belvoir Street anyway and then em and  
,BROWN "  
BROWN BROWN  
then it turns right onto Major Street and then along Ternplemore  
Avenue and em obviously you've said that yourself then eh in  
parking in Langtry Couti  

(Inaudible). 
BROWN Cause we know that's where, where we're at so that's what this piece is going to show then. 
Eh 2116 hours.

2006/07(1) 
Page 7 of30 That's the vehicle going along the Newtownards Road. Okay so at this stage then that's, that's where we are, that, that's the CCTV to place it coming from em Pitt Place then obviously to Wye Street whether that's to pick up Mark Sewell, to get him to the Albert Bar em that altercation with Hettie and her daughter and then em say the 4, 5 ofyou'se are all there at that stage. You then come eh along the Newtownards Road, down Newtownards Road, down Belvoir Street, down Major Street, down onto Templemore Avenue and into Langtry Court. So that that's, that's following that way. So obviously then the next pmi is is the pmi that we've already shown you the CCTV then on the Albertb1idge Road which clearly shows em the 5 of you in a group all going together to Cluan Place to carry out the murder okay and obviously that's, that's where you'se meet with Ian Ogle, say stabbed 11 times, he's peak, he's beaten, he's punched and he's on the ground and he, his head stamped on so it's a vicious, a vicious attack on him and obviously the em pastor is a witness, he's standing there witnessing somebody being murdered which must be really, really difficult for him. Em so that's where all of that happens then you're seen again em the 5 ofyou'se all coming back towards Templemore Avenue. We obviously then have the witnesses who see the car parked at Langtry Court, she sees two people here she sees two people walking off down Madrid Street and 3 people getting into the car. So that's where we are at that stage.Em then it leaves Langtry Comi onto Templemore Avenue and then believe it probably turns onto Major Street and then onto the Newtownards Road again before driving along Dee Street. Em believe that's probably you dropping off em the 4 suspects at their home addresses or whatever cause obviously you won't tell us that Jonathan what you do at that stage and we can on!y. 
You're saying 4 but you told me in the other statement that there was only 3 in the car. 
Sorry 3 you're 1ight,3 in, in from Langtry, you're right to c01Tect me that's right. So but the, the obvious thing is I don't know whether you've picked up the other two or not so I don't know whether there's.

BROWN  No comment. Cause I'm going to tell you what, what I know is that you went back into the house at that time as you can see you em go back there, the car goes back there. You go back into the house, you go up the stairs. You come back down the stairs and you give Jill a bag and that bag was the bag that we had showed you on the previous em photographs and I'm just going to show you again cause obviouslythis is a photograph again of the car of the Leon em photograph onen. and again on photograph two. That car itself is there, if it's forensically tested is there anything that's going to link any of you'se to Ian Ogle in that car.  
]3ROWN BROWN  No comment. Is there likely to be anything, any DNA from him, any blood from him, anything from him. No comment.  

Or anything that's going to link anybody else to that car, I know obviously you dtive the car so I would imagine we're going to find like DNA fingerprints from yourself but what about any of the other fi, 4 who were involved in this. 
No comment. And anything at all from Ian that we're going to find in it. 
BROWN 
--�-.
No comment. 
That's album GB6 yeah.

BROWN  No comment.  
And would there be any reason for him to have ever been in the car.  

BROWN  No cmrunent.  

So obviously we're, we're back then em to the back of the car and obviously we see the small pink satch smi ofnlike backpack and it's not very clear so we, that's photograph 6, we'll go to photograph 7 I say it's just the interior of the car again. Okay so em what you can  

( see there then is in the back sort of the car we talked about that bag, that's actually a JD bag, does that belong to you. 
BROWN No comment. 
And what, what's in that bag. 
No comment. 
BROWN Did you give that bag for Jill to put into the back of that car.

See maybe get a better close, a close up yeah. So same album, GB6, photograph 11as you can see that's a, that's a better photograph of eh the trainers that we showed you earlier in the bag, were they your

And will they come back to, to you, you know your DNA.

BROWN  No comment.  
And is that the hat that you wore when you were em at the murder.  
BROWN  No comment.

The bag that we've talked about em that bag was found in the back obviously of the Seat Leon, did you go up the stairs, whenever you go home obviously we've seen on CCTV that you go home, you back to Jill's house and em you go up the stairs and you bring down this bag cause Jill describes this bag and you give it to her. Is that the case. 
BROWN No comment. 
Why did you give her the bag. 
BROWN No comment. 
Cause obviously if you're wearing these at a murder scene and you've given that to Jill you've implicated her in trying to get rid of the stuff by putting it in the car. You know items that belong to a murder scene, why would you do that to your girlfriend. 
No comment. 
BROWN 
BROWN 
� . 
. 
BROWN 
BROWN 
Were you panicked then and just didn't care. 
No comment. 
Cause that's a difficult thing to do you know to implicate her, she's got a young gir, a young child at home but you've obviously implicated her. So what I !mow is that you give this bag to Jill and you tell her to put that in the footwell of the car. Is that the case. 
No comment. And why do you tell her to do that. 
No comment. 
I believe you tell her to do that so as it can be got rid of cause you
didn't want police to get those trainers or that hat because you were 
wearing those at the time of the murder, is that correct. 
BROWN No conunent.

Page 13 of30 
BROWN  So that's my belief is em that tho, that bag she would describe it you give her the bag em she felt like there was maybe trainers in it and then you've told her to put the bag in the footwell and move the car. So by asking her to do all of that and I know that's difficult thing to hear but you can see it from Jill's point of view because if Jill, ifwe test that and Jill's fingerprints and DNA and all's on it she's totally implicated then on that so she has to tell us the truth so she's just being open and honest and truthful with us because she just has to look after her own interests and as I say she has a young child so I think that's important that she looks after her own interest as I said to you Jonathan it's up to you to look after your own interests as well you know all these people that are involved you know youdon't have loyalties to them or whatever your loyalties are, they're probably false loyalties, you need to look after yourself, your own family and protect yourselves. So if there's something then that you need to tell us then tell us you know because obviously these were put, told to be put away for a reason and then Jill moves the car into as you will see at the back here, Pitt Place, there's like a wee enclave and did you tell her to move that in there in case police came looking. No comment.  

So we'll just show you then the footage then that this, so that's how we sort ofwe know that that's the right car and that's you getting out because Jill would say yes you did come back to em the house and whenever you see it here. It's a wee bit difficult because there's a car there with the lights on. That's coming back. And parking up. Can you see that okay. Snre that's (i1rnudible).  

And this is the car (inaudible). So yeah I, I think actually we've just missed a bit. Yeah. Really what, what this pati is you've already. l 'll play.

Eh 2145 hours. That's the lights going on. (Inaudible). I can't see it terribly well. Yeah. 
( \ 
Can you tilt the (inaudible). Yeah, yeah sorry the car's now moving. Moving. Into Pitt Place then. And that's into the wee alleyway, did you tell her to move it in there 
so if the police came round looking they'll not see the car. BROWN 
No c01m11ent. 
Then you should see a figure then coming back from where the car is parked in Pitt Place back towards eh Jill's house and that's confirmed in her, her. 
Emmnhmm. 
Account. 
Yeah I mean she, she would say yes she did move, you've asked her to move the car, yes she did move the car and yes she did come back to the house then cause her child's obviously at home. Okay em so just then I, I think that's em I think that's all of the CCTV Jonathan em obviously then these trainers, is there anything on any of this that's going to link you to Ian Ogle.

view it's, it's obviously you're telling her to get rid of them and I say that's, that's a big thing to implicate her in that because obviously that's an offence by assisting offenders you know helping you out after that. So really that's, that's what we have to show you and I know obviously we've talked about the knife and you know we've talked about the injuries to Ian and we've talked about all the stab wounds and stuff and you know could it be a case then that you have brought the knife with you from Wolff Close whenever you get into the car. ls it a case that you have supplied the knife to somebody else, the guy that we see in the green coat, did you give the knife to him.

On a trainer and why did you think that.  
BROWN  Cause I pulled the fella off like I said in that statement.  
Okay. Had you any other contact with em with Ian, I know you've talked about sort of bit of a good Samaritan you've tried to pull the fella off you know told him to get off em had you any involvement then in the stabbing of him.  
BROWN  No.  

Or the kicking of him, did you kick him at all. 
BROWN No. 
Did you punch him. 
BROWN  No.

I don't know. Is this is a. No comment. Did she believe then that there was blood on your top, is that what it was. No comment. Em eh enough to be charged with them which assumes murder and I'm sure they have other things and other people there, so you know obviously em we've conducted searches and things em Jonathan but obviously we don't have your top, where is your top. No comment. Was it destroyed at all. No comment. Did you destroy it. 

No comment. Have you hidden it somewhere. 
No comment. 
Can you tell me what you've done with it. 

BROWN  No comment.

So are you saying that whenever we showed you the photographs earlier on and asked you what the red mark was em that's when you realised there was blood on your trainer.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Did you realise at any other time that there was blood on your trainer.  
BROWN  No connnent.  
And do you, do you think that there was you know p1ior to us showing you, excuse me, any photographs.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Cause we'll refer back to the, the JD bag, the shoes and the bobble hat, is that why you asked Jill to get 1id of those items.  
BROWN  No comment.  
Is that because you knew that there, there may well be blood on them  

. BROWN No comment. 
Okay so I'm just going to show you photograph album here and em that is DT3 and DT3 is photographs obviously of your 
trainers. Photograph one em you know what they do is they do testing you know for habitual user, you know somebody who uses them all the time and then they're obviously testing for other things em so prior to today you, you 're saying that you didn't realise whether there was likely to be blood on those or not but now you think there is, is that co1Tect.  
BROWN  No comment.  
BROWN  And obviously photograph 2 is photograph again of the trainer and again photograph 3 you can see some markings of where they take em items and photograph 4 is measurements and photograph 5 shows the back of the trainer. Photograph 6 shows the side and 7 then shows the you know tread on it and 8 then just another photograph and these are mainly just and 9 all photographs of the trainer and different areas where they'vetested and things em basically these things go to the Jab and it's. Hmm. Sort of tested, 10 and 11t, 12, I say all again just with some markings on them. Mmm 13, 14 the back again. Eh 15' s just the  

tread and 16 em is another area again so obviously these are just, this is, this is the trainers that were submitted and these are the trainers from the bag in the car ah so I'm just going to read you the results of those. Em I say they were put into the Jab obviously for habitual using and for em the blood and I mean obviously you haven't at any stage told us that about blood or anything on your shoes until em this interview when you knew we were going to put forensic evidence to you. Em so what the em the biologist is saying that eh GB 1 eh there's DNA in from the inside the heel and the laces and the major profile matches you, okay matches yourself and there's DNA from the 
2006/07(1) 
t�UUUfft�1! 
Person Interviewed: BROWN,JONATHAN DA YID HARRY Form MG15(T) 
Page 5 of20 

bloodstain and the ma, major profile matches Ian Ogle, okay so there, there's definitely Ian Ogle's blood is on those trainers, does that surprise you at all. 
BROWN No cause like I told you in my statement there that I tried to pull the fella off so there's no doubt that's why the reason being on it. Okay did you see any blood at the time. 
BROWN No. And the fella who was stabbing him did any, did you see anyblood anywhere. 
BROWN 
No. Okay cause if you're pulling him off how come it's only on your trainer. 
BROWN 
No comment. Or is there blood another, the rest of your clothing and you've 
' 
got rid of that. BROWN 
" 
No comment. Cause I say we don't have any other clothing, do you still have the clothing you were wearing that night. 
BROWN 
No comment. And if you had would you be happy to hand that over to police. 
BROWN No comment. 
BROWN 
BROWN BROWN BROWN 
2006/07(1) 
So GB2 then sorry em GB 1 is the right trainer and GB2 is the left trainer. And there's DNA from the inside the heel and the laces and the major profile matches yourself and DNA from a bloodstain A is a complex mixture and there's a major profiles match em yourself and Ian Ogle. So there's a mixture of yourself and Ian Ogle on that, on the left trainer and DNA from a bloodstain B matches Ian Ogle. So on this left trainer there's em blood matching Ian and on your right trainer so on both trainers. So em is it the case that em Jonathan that whenever that you weren't pulling somebody off but that you were kicking at Ian ah while he was being stabbed and that's how the blood got on. No definitely not. Or is it the case that you were stabbing him and the bloods dripped onto your trainers. Definitely not. Or you were one of the males holding his arms as the Pastor desc1.becl. No. Cause I, I don't believe that your only role down there Jonathan was just pulling somebody off you know you'se went clown. That's your opinion. Yeah you'se went down for a fight and I would imagine then if you're going down for a fight that's what you do. Is that the 
t�1@@Mt�1! 
Person Interviewed: BROWN,JONATHAN DA YID HARRY Form MG15(T) 
Page 6 of20 case. BROWN 
No response. Okay so what I'm going to show you now is em still imagesfrom police exhibit SCS6 em these are just images sort of that we've shown you earlier but they're just stills from it. Now I will say they're not super quality but em I think you can see okay em what they are. So this is em this is on the way down em this is on the way down to the murder and that shows a photograph of what we believe is you and I would say that really you, you would be able to tell that that was you from that, would you agree. 
BROWN No comment. Okay and that's, we'd said to you in the eh CCTV that youknow the person with the stripe and the stripes down the arms that we did believe was you because from if you have the, the still images you would be able to tell that it was yourself. And, and these are em. 
BROWN 
Beforehand my statement was give before this anyway so. SOLICITOR 
(Inaudible). So this is at 2119 hours but you haven't said which one was definitely you so that's, that's what we're, why we're showing you this is to say well this is the reason really why we know that it is you em because you were given that opportunity and didn't take it and then the second photograph agam is just a photograph which we do believe is you. Now. Yeah we were. Smry. Say that that's the action of you tightening the, your hood around your face. Emmnhmm. To hide it. ---.
Yeah cause this is actually on the way down Jonathan to be honest and I know em a lot of people have talked about youknow scarves over faces and hiding faces and, and yes youwould say you were there but, but Danny's tight that seems to be an action of you tightening like a scarf on your hood around your face so as you're not identified. Because you're part of the gang that go to murder Ian. 
Would you agree with that. BROWN No. And why have you the scarf up over your face then. BROWN Don't, don't have a, I didn't have a scarf. You don't have a scarf. 
BROWN No definitely not. ls that just your hood then are you telling me that you've tightened round.

No. Rather than. No comment. 
You know rather than a scarf. 
No comment. 
And I say it is a wee bit grainy that em probably. 
Yeah cause it looks like it's all the exact same as that there now so. Hmm. Looks like all the same as that down the side so. Yeah and I say I, I haven't done the stills as such so I'm not sure but that's obviously the question is, is that a scarf that you'retightening round your face. No. Or is it just your hood. No comment. To hide your identity. Cause that's obviously what everyone was doing, they were all hiding their identity. Em I think this is just a. Just a shoe. Yeah that's, that's, think that's just to show em the shoe that you're wearing em yeah you know with the tick on it to match obviously the, the shoe's here and we're pretty sure that the, the you know they are the same shoes, the shape and everything and obviously that would be checked but with the tick and stuff you know so we're happy enough that they're the same shoes, that they are the shoes that you were wearing and obviously Ian's blood's on those shoes so I'm assuming that they are the same shoes, would that be correct. No comment. 

And again that is just to show sort of that's your leg and that's  
the shoe again. And again it's just another of the shoe. Yeah so  
that's just the back of em of you there as you're, you're walking  
towards the murder. I think that's just as it's quite blurry.  
More clothing (inaudible).  
Yeah hmm.  
It's just the clothing, the top.  
Yeah ah ha, I think these are more just to show what you were  
wearing and  can  you tell  me where that, that clothing is,  
obviously we have the trainers, what about your top, that top,  
where is that.  
BROWN  No c01mnent.  
What you're wearing underneath or.  
BROWN  No comment.  
And you obviously seemed to have like jogging bottoms on  
there as you can see there, where are they.

BROWN  No comment.  
And this is coming back from the murder then at 2120. And in these photographs although it's not overly clear when, when you look at it on the CCTV it shows you you know you appear to be looking down at your shoes so were you aware at that time that there was blood on your shoes.  
BROWN  Well if, if I had've been doing any stabbings I'm sure would've been plenty on my hand.  
And was there cause we didn't.  
BROWN  No well you can see my hands there clear.  
Well it's eh to be fair it's not that clear. You know but we, we know that you're looking at your shoes for, for definite eh and that's we believe that you're looking cause you know there is some blood on your shoes. Is that the case.  
BROWN  No comment.  

And were you trying to get rid of that blood. BROWN No comment. 
And again I say that's just of yourself and I think, I think that's fair to say that that is you. Would you agree. 
BROWN No comment. 
And again just yourself. That's just more photographs, I say they really just shows that it is you and that is your clothing. 
Emmnhmm. So we think we're, we're, we're happy and satisfied enough that that the person in the blue is you. The shoes and the hat that was seized from the Seat Leon. Yeah cause I think maybe you can actually, I just wanted to check to you about the hat as well cause obviously we've showed you the hat and I know it's difficult there to see but you appear to have like a grey, the grey hat on under your hood there. Would you agree with that. 
BROWN 
There's no scarf. Hmm. Okay. That's a fair enough if you're saying that but you would say that the grey hat, that's the grey hat. 
BROWN 
No comment. I don't know whether that round your neck is a scarf or is that like a t-shirt or a top or something. 
BROWN  No comment. Okay and then l say these are just of you em leaving the scene. And I say on it we can see you looking down at your shoes so we believe at that stage that you know that there's likely to be blood on your shoes. I think that's just of the shoe you know down to your foot to see the front of the shoe there. And that's just down your leg towards the shoe. And again I say I agree  
2006/07(1)  

t�l@=Mt+1! 
Person Interviewed: BROWN,JONATHAN DAVID HARRY Fann MGl5(T) 

Page 9 of20 that they are a wee bit grainy but that's just full picture of yourself. And again on that one. And I say that's just again of your shoe so I, I think to be honest Jonathan that it's, it's fair to say that em whenever yon are em coming away from the scene that you're looking down cause you know that there's blood, I know you've only just told us that in this last interview em because but I think you, you're fairly aware that there was always likely to be blood found on your shoes because you were 
there and you did tell us fair enough that you were there but you haven't told us of any, any part that you took just say, just like this good guy goes down, sees him, goes down afterwards, seemg him being stabbed and then pulls him off which obviously from what other people are saying doesn't be, appear to be the case. Is there anything in relation to this part that you want to say Danny. 



�,\ Noeem. ' No so. And just to clarify is it the point then that you know there's blood on your shoes and that's why you gave them to, to Jill. BROWN No comment. So really just em to, to, to round up everything that's, that's happened em today so what we believe really has happened is and do you know what most of all of this is backed up with evidence either from CCTV from phone records, from eye witnesses, from statements and all of that so believe is, excuse me, Ian or Neil Ogle rings you em that's confinned that, that's 

fair enough that's em in your phone record. He rings you to tell you that Ryan and Ian have beat him pretty badly. Now whether you went down to see the injuries or whether you just took his word for it, it's unclear cause you won't tell us that. Em believe then that Neil has asked you to orgamse something, get something together whether you're like the mister fix it guy round the area, s01is these things out, I don't know cause youwon't tell me that either. You then get 4 or 5, get 5, another 4 people together and from your phone records believe that that is a possibility of the people that you get together. You then take Jill's car and you go towards Wye Street and that's probably for picking up em. Sewell Mr Sewell and then you go to the Albe1i Bar and we know the altercation happens at the, at the Albert Bar that you go into the Albe1i, the Prince Albert, that's there altercation between Hettie and em Mark Sewell, that all of that takes place all back up then with the CCTV em about with you'se coming out that whether there was one person sat in the car and 4 or 3 of you'se went, 4 of you'se went in or whether you'se picked somebody else up on the way we're not sure cause you won't tell us any of that 
2006/07(1) 
,,,aa,er..,e 
Person Interviewed: BROWN,JONATHAN DAVID HARRY Fonn MG15(T) 
Page 10 of20 
either. You then go down the Newtownards Road backed upwith CCTV and then you park up in Langtry told by yourself so we know that. We also know from eye witnesses that that has all happened. You then go round to em to Cluan Place, you said you're going for a fight, I believe that you'se have went with the intent to murder Ian Ogle. I think that's your intent right away because that is a short altercation, that is not something that's prolonged that you know you'se, you'se go for a fight, there's a bit of a fight and everybody's you know fighting back and fotwards, somebody sees the red mist and stabs him. This is straight in, everybody on him like hyenas, that's, that's how the pastor described it and he is stabbed 11 times and he's brutallybeaten and somebody comes back and stamps on his head and this guy is dead and I think that that was your intention to goand do that and you have given me a very limited account of all of that just that you go, you pull somebody off and em then you 
( 
leave. You won't elaborate on any of it, you won't tell me who's involved, you won't tell me about em how it's arranged, where it's ananged, why it's ananged or your pmi in it. But we believe that you and know that you were obviously involved in your own admission you were there, we believe you're involved in that. You then leave and we can see you leaving on the CCTV not a great bit or urgency with you and that you go back to the car. You then go back to that, your own car and there's 3 ofyou'se get into that and where the other two go you won't tell us that either. You won't tell me who's in the car but we do know that you travel about a bit cause we've seen that on CCTV and you go back to Jill's house. We know that you go into Jill's house, we know that you go up the stairs and we know then that you come down and hand her a bag with those trainers with blood on it and with that hat that we believe that you are wearing cause as you can see in the still it appears to be like a grey hat there. There's also a lot of money in that. You then tell her, implicate her by telling her to go and put that money into the car and to move the car and she's your girlfriend, she does that for you. So she moves the car, you then leave those premises cause when police come you're not there and youwon't tell us where you go, who you're with, what you've done with your clothing, why you got Jill to put the bag there obviously we know is because the blood's on it that's whyyou've done that but the two thousand pounds, you don't saywhat that was for. We believe that was em for either you to pay somebody or else it was for you to get out of the countrybecause that's what you do quite soon after this murder. And you know if you're innocent you didn't come to police,confidential telephone, say look this all went wrong I tried to pull him off, you haven't come and told anybody, you ran away.Now you did eventually come back and we think that you did 
2006/07(1) 
t�1@@trirn!
Person Interviewed: BROWN,JONATHAN DAVID HARRY Fann MG15(T) Page 11 of20 
eventually come back because you believed that there was verylittle on you and obviously because of the WhatsApp you know there is that bit of a conversation about you know oh they only have me at the car and I'll go and I'll tell them this and that seems to be the story that you have come and told us but obviously from all the evidence that we have put to you and everything that we have shown you, you know most of it's all facts, CCTV' s fact, your phone records are fact, you know what people are saying, two independent people saying a similar story at the scene. So all of that is all fact and we have that but your story is very, very limited. So that is what I am putting to you, is that the case, is that what happened.  
SOLICITOR  Is what happened.  
All of just what I have put to you.  
SOLICITOR  Did you murder this man.  
'\BROWN  I did not murder Ian Ogle.  

Does the whole scenatio that I've just said to you is that how that whole night panned out. 
BROWN All I've give you my statement, I did not murder Ian Ogle and that's it. 
Is there anything else that you want to say, you want to clatify. 
BROWN No. 
Okay. Danny is there anything you want to say. 
No. 
Last opp01iunity just here em Jonathan you know if you want to tell us anything, if you want to tell us whose involved or youwant to tell us how the whole night panned out this is your last opp01iunity today to do that. Do you want to say anything. 
BROWN No. Okay. I'm just going to finish up the interview then it's still the l' of February 2019, time by the interview room clock is 2136. CHECKED AND CERTIFIED AS ACCURATE TRANSCRIPT OF DISC. NO. 98 IRSF34 1397. INTERVIEW
