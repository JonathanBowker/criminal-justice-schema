people who have previously seen Neil Ogle in that bar.
Are you trying to say when you say it's a matter of minutes
what do.
I believe this is in a round nine o'clock em.
Yes.
Uh huh.
This is about twe twenty-one eh it'll be covered in the CCTV.
Yeah .

So bearing in mind Neil's just been assaulted at 2040 to 2050
ish em and yourself and Neil are now in the Albert Bar ten to
twenty minutes later making threats against people who have
seen Neil in that bar previously and that bar wouldn't be far
from where he's assaulted so I might be wrong in making the

assumption if I am tell me but it sounds to me like Neil has
make contact or someone has made contact with you and told
you that he has been assaulted and that they're to blame
because they have seen him leaving the bar and have
therefore been in touch with Ian Ogle and Ryan Johnston and
therefore that's why they're getting the blame because they
had put ne, they've given Neil's location away, is that, is that
right, do you understand what I'm saying ok.
No comment.
Is that why you threatened Harriet.
No comment.
And Lisa because you thought that they had given Ian and
Ryan Neil's location and knowing that he was on his own so
that they would be able to go and attack him on the
Beersbridge Road.
No comment.
And that haven't heard this has happened a few minutes later
you then go on Neil's say so or someone else's say so to go
and threaten them to make you know to make sure they know
that they should not have done that.
No comment.
And then you took it one step further and go and see Ian Ogle.
No comment.
Could I just ask sorry is it, do we know why Hettie didn't make
her statement then until the 2nd.
Eh no we don't.
And when in fact she actually made her first em or whether or
not there was an indication, well obviously em Lisa had said
on the.
29th that she had been in the company of Hettie but do we
know when Hettie had made contact with the police.

And as he would describe it Ian Ogle was expecting this in
some shape or form, he was talking to the pastor he he knew
there was going to be trouble that night em and when the five
males approached he walked away from the pastor, he
expected trouble of some kind that evening after what had
happened to Neil Ogle, he knew there was going to be
something happening but I wouldn't have, I wouldn't think he
expected it to the extent that it actually went to I think he
expected a hiding or something like that. Is that the case that
was the plan.

The male was described as thin, around 5'8 or 5'9, grey or
light coat with a hood which was up with a reflective stripe on
the inside of the left arm. Stripe on the outside of the trousers
colour not known. Face covered. He turned back up towards
the Albertbridge Road and shouted something. He reached
the corner of Langtry Court, ok opposite the baths and then
stopped. Eh Gary then saw a second male eh following him
ok, this person was slightly shorter and heavier build, black
trousers and black coat, hood up, lighter scarf around the,
over the bottom of his face. He was holding a knife shining in
the light, eight inch metal blade, one straight edge and one
curved.
Sorry was that eight inch blade.
Metal blade eh one straight edge and one curved. So again
we've shown you the images from the bus stop, the second
male in that footage we believe is carrying the knife away from
the scene, is this male still carrying the knife are you aware.
No comment.
Male one and two eh turned to face the Albertbridge Road and
three more males were walking towards him. Ok so we would
say then this would be eh yourself Mark eh Johnny Brown and
eh Glen Rainey ok. And again if not just tell us. The three
males had hooded, hoods up and their faces covered. Ok, he
describes male one and two, the first two, turned into mid
Madrid Street and out of sight, ok so they've left on foot. Ok is
that correct, is that what happened.
No comment.
Did the first two males leave on foot.
No comment.
Eh three males eh walked down and turned into Langtry Court
and got into a five door Seat car, JGZ 7406, parked there
facing Templemore Avenue.

Ok then em we'll go through the post mortem findings then in
relation to Ian Ogle's eh murder so Doctor Peter Ingram
carried out the post mortem and his initial findings were as
follows. There was evidence of collapse injury to the left side
of the head resulting in a fractured skull. The fracture was of a
minor nature and the brain was not damaged. Did you cause
injury to Ian Ogle's head that night.

There are three bruises on the scalp possibly kicked to the
right side of the head although no visible footwear marks.
There was a tiny mark on the back of the head. Defence
injuries to the forearms, bruising eh there is bruising over the
right hand knuckles, this supports striking someone or
something. Did Ian fight back Mark.

There are a further nine stab injuries on the back, one of the
wounds entered the left chest cavity and damaged the aorta,
ok so eh his heart basically ok, in through the back, sorry in
through the left chest a rea and damaged the aorta ok. This
was a fatal stab, sorry this was a fatal injury and even if it
occurred in the A&E department it would not have been

No comment.
We've mentioned it before in the interview process that this is
what has killed Ian, the knife, em the knife wounds ok so that
is why we're, it's crucial that we identify the person who was
carrying that, this is a dangerous individual still out potentially
in society em and capable of carrying out further attacks like
this. We're not saying at this point in time that you had
knowledge of this knife being used or being carried that
particular night but we need your help to help us to identify
who did do it if, if you were one of those members of the rest
of the group who were simply there for a fight there's a
massive difference between going there to beat someone up
and going there with the intention of taking a man's life and
obviously the the court would would treat persons differently
not to say there's no offence involved in going to beat
someone up (inaudible} anyway but if if you had no knowledge
of there being a knife and it was not your intention to go there
to murder Ian Ogle this is your time to say that and identify the
person who did carry the knife. Can you tell us who who had
that the knife that night.
No.
Did you have knowledge of that knife.
No comment.
Because without you telling us any different we can only
assume that you have all gone there with the knowledge that
someone has carried a knife and with the intention of
murdering Ian Ogle.

that's you shouting more abuse at Hett'le and Lisa, isn't that

No.

you'll see another person coming out of the bar. Ok there's
another person. And there's the veh'icle dr'1ving off, just let me

There's no more eh CCTV at this stage that's relevant to
yourself ok Mark. So it's the end of the CCTV. To summarise
from this interview ok, I'm just using the map then ok. The
Seat Leon, JGZ 4 em leaves Pitt Place ok and then at 2 1 1 4
hours it's here at the Albert Bar ok and two females put you in
the company of Johnny Brown who is driving that car.
No.
See you getting into it, one of them sees you getting into it at
2 1 1 4 hours.
No.
The car then travels down the Newtownards Road and then it
is parked up in Langtry Court and then we have the CCTV
from the glider bus stop at 21 1 9 hours and the following
minute after the the murder and we say that that is you that
still from CS6 is you.
No comment.
And it's no comment because you have no other wa, you can't
tell us where you were because you were involved in this.
No.
You were seen four minutes, five minutes sorry before the
murder in the company of a man Johnny Brown that admits
driving people to the murder.
No.
You were in that car and you're in that glider footage.

I mean Jonathan Brown is clearly linked through his vehicle and to
be fair to him he admits his role in this here but you don't. Did you
wait until those two come back.

Before you come to police.
SEWELL No comment.
Is it because you're in charge.
SEWELL No.
You're in charge of those two and the other two that we haven't
identified.
SEWELL No.
As I said during that six week period eh from the time of the
murder eh until your arrest on the 1 ih of March then, police eh
make numerous attempts to locate you and I'm going to go
through a couple of statements to indicate that then. So the first is
a Constable Kelly dated the 29th of March 2019. I am a Constable
in the Police Service of Northern Ireland presently attached to
Strandtown PSNI Station, East Belfast. On Friday the 1 st of
February 201 9, I was on duty and in uniform accompanied by
Constable Sewell. On that date I attended 14 Wye Street, Belfast
and attempted to serve a threat message against, on sorry, eh
Mark Sewell, DOB 10 12 78. However he was not pre, he was not
present. On that date I spoke to Cathy McConnell who was
present at that property okay, the same Cathy McConnell that I've
talked about doing a purchase on that phone okay. We were
invited in and, and she informed us that she had no contact with
Mark Sewell and became upset that police were continuously
calling to her house. Constable Sewell and I explained to her that
it was necessa􀅽 for us to attend in order to locate Mark Sewell.
On Friday the 8 h of February 2019 I was on duty and in uniform
and accompanied by a Constable McCarten. At approximately
1 930 hours I attended 14 By, Wye Street, Belfast. There was no
response when I knocked at the door. On Saturday the 9th of
February 201 9 I was on duty and in uniform accompanied by
Constable Donnelly. At 1 91 5 hours I attended 14 Wye Street,
Belfast. I rang the bell and knocked the door, there was no
answer to the door. At 2330 hours I called at 3 Aigburth Park,
Belfast, the address you gave us for yourself earlier Mark and
spoke to a male who identified himself as Mark Sewell's father.
So they tried your partner Cathy and now they're trying your
father. I asked if Mark Sewell was in the house, he informed me
that he had not seen Mark Sewell. I explained that I was looking
for Mark Sewell and police had to speak to him directly. At 2035
hours I called at 16 lnvernook Park Parade and knocked at the
door. There was no answer to the door. On Wednesday the 1 3th
of February 2019 I was on duty and in uniform accompanied by

Constable Mcilwaine. At approximately 0830 hours I called to 1 4
Wye Street, Belfast and spoke with Cathy McConnell. She
informed me she still had no contact with Mark Sewell, that she
didn't have a number for him and she would contact police if she
had any contact with him. At approximately 845 hours I called to 3
Aigburth Park, Belfast and spoke with a female, home owner who
told us Mark Sewell had made no contact with her and that she
would let police know if he did. At 850 hours I called to 1 6
lnvernook Park, Belfast and spoke with a male who identified
himself to be Mark's brother. He also stated that he had not seen
Mark and had no number for him. I had no further dealings in this
matter okay. So over that period then they've called with your
partner, eh your father, eh and your brother there okay and they're
all saying they haven't seen you Mark. Now they're not reporting
to us that you're missing or that you're in any danger. So again
where were you during this period.
No comment.
Were you aware that police were looking for you.
No comment.
Did anyone tell you that police were looking for you.
No comment.
Okay then eh Constable Sewell's state, eh 25th of March '1 9. I am
a Constable in the Police Service of Northern Ireland presently
attached to Strandtown Station. On Friday the 1 st of February
201 9 I was on duty and in uniform accompany Constable Kelly. I
was tasked to attend 1 4 Wye Street, Belfast to make enquiries into
locating Mark Sewell, date of birth 1 0 12 1 978. I knocked on the
front door of 1 4 Wye Street and was invited inside the property by
a female who I know to be Gath, now know to be Catherine
McConnell. Catherine McConnell was extremely upset and stated
that she was sick of police calling at the property. I asked
Catherine McConnell if she knew where Mark Sewell was and she
stated her and Mark were not together and he was probably drunk
in a bar somewhere. I asked Catherine that if she saw Mark to
contact police and she said she wouldn't be seeing him. There
were a number of other people inside the property at the time. I
had no further eh dealings with this incident okay. So again
throughout those statements and I'm going to go through a log
here to demonstrate the police are locating trying to locate you
Mark and you bee, you're well aware police are but you're evading
police. Isn't that correct.
No comment.

Okay shortly after the murder then emm and as well as trying to
locate you to arrest and interview you eh you become under a
threat message okay and it's police duty to inform you of this
threat message and give you advice in relation to that there. So a
log is set up eh to, to record eh calls in attempts to locate you
okay. So the first one here is, is on the 1 st of February okay
1 01 2 hours, eh an officer calls at 1 4 Wye Street and spoke to
Catherine McConnell eh and that police needed to speak with
Mark Sewell. Catherine stated that they had a row on Saturday
and she hadn't seen or heard from him since, the day before the,
the murder okay, the day you're purchasing the top-up. Catherine
stated that she thinks he would be on the drink and stated that she
doesn't have a mobile phone okay. Yes on the same date they
call at 3 Aigburth Park eh speak to Mark Sewell's father and
mother and they state that they didn't know where he was but
would get him to contact police if they heard from him. Eh called
at lnvernook Park and spoke with Stephen Matthews and Michael
Sewell, brackets your brother. They appeared in deep
conversation ah a walk and a talk okay. Is Michael Sewell your
brother.
No comment.
Okay. So has any of these people made you aware that police
were looking for you in this period.
No comment.
Your partner or ex-partner, your parents or your brother. Emm on
the same date, eh the 1 st of February at 1215 eh a call-sign calls
at 1 2 New Barnsley Crescent and spoke with a, a Barry O'Toole
ah and stated that his step-son Connor McConnell who we've
talked about was present okay. 2nd of February emm 4 minutes
past midnight you know to try different times of the day, eh called
at 1 4 Wye Street and spoke to Cathy McConnell. She was
extremely eh annoyed and upset at police calling at her house
again, she was crying and said she was sick of it and her and
Mark were not together. I asked if she knew where Mark was and
she said, probably drunk in a bar somewhere. Cathy was left with
family members who were with her, also very aggressive and
angry towards police. I asked if they see him could they contact
police and they stated we won't be seeing him. Eh the following
morning 948 hours again another Constable calls at 14 Wye Street
and spoke ah with your, your partner okay. Eh she offered a
check of the property and a cursory check was carried out. The

same officer then calls at 3 Aigburth Park and your mother
answered the door and she said that she hadn't seen you in three
weeks and she appeared distressed. Again they called then at
lnvernook Park, answered by the partner of Michael Sewell,
saying Mark wasn't there okay. Later the, again then on the 3rd
the following day emm attempts have been made to contact this
person okay. All attempts have provided negative. Eh the
person's family are well aware and that we wish to speak with him,
emm have been advised to get cont, contact with us as soon as
possible. These calls continue then eh the 5th of February 1 4 Wye
Street, 001 5 hours, in darkness no answer to door. Eh half an
hour later 3 Aigburth emm again darkness, no answer to door and
again emm 1 6 lnvernook Park. The 6th of February eh called at
1 6 lnvernook Park and spoke with Michael Sewell, not spoken to
Mark in weeks and asked police to stop calling at his house. It
was explained that police would have to continue to call until he,
yourself eh is located as we have an urgent message to· pass, that
being that you're under threat I believe. Michael was asked if he
speaks to Mark to ask him to contact 1 01 so arrangements can be
made. Eh Aigburth Park and 1 4 Wye Street are also called at, at
that time and again you're not there. Eh again the three
addresses are called at on the y

midnight eh all three houses are in darkness eh with no signs of
life. Seven.
Did you say you said that earlier on you said you, my client
became a suspect at an early stage. Eh can you confirm what
date he became suspect.
I can't confirm the date.
But was he, was he a suspect at that stage.
Yes.
Right so as well as saying the police are looking to speak to him to
deliver a threat message, they're actually looking to speak to him

March to the to two of, to two of the addresses, ?1h of March eh
Wye Street and the 8th of March.
(Inaudible).
Right okay. Eh and finally on the 1 oth of March eh police call sign
called at 14 Wye Street, no answer to the door, okay. So police
have been continually calling for 5, 6 weeks in relation to this
murder investigation and in relation to the threat okay. You're well
aware police are looking for you but you don't come forward to the
1 zlh and we'd say that's because you're waiting isn't that correct
Mark.
SEWELL No.
You're waiting for.
The other ones.
The other ones to.
To be interviewed.
Come forward and see what they have to say and see what we
have as police as evidence okay. Is that correct Mark.
SEWELL No.
We've been through these statements. Okay eh Mark you were
arrested emm for the offence of murder and witness intimidation
on the 1zlh of March 2019 and you've been interviewed eh several
times by police both on that date and on today's date and it is your
right not to answer any of the questions put to you eh but as I've
already highlighted, should this matter go to the court then
inferences can be drawn if you decide to give an account in
relation to any of these matters eh that I've put to you during the
interview process. Eh throughout the interview process we have
shown you the following evidence and I'll go through it which links
you to this murder. This is not just circumstantial evidence and
you've been identified by both police as being one of the five
members in this group and civilian witnesses placing you in the
company of Jonathan Brown in the Prince Albert Bar and those
being the civilian witnesses that you were arrested for intimidation
for okay. So I'll say telephone records show that you or show
telephone records show contact between you and Jonathan Brown
during the period between the attack of Neil Ogle and Ian Ogle.
The telephone calls I outlined you to earlier and you subsequently
turned your phone off after that. CCTV shows a car similar to a
Seat Leon driving away from the direction of 14 Wye Street at

CCTV and witnesses' evidence places you in the Prince Albert Bar
with Jonathan Brown immediately prior to the attack on the Ian
Ogle. You're agitated threatening and aware of the injuries to Neil
Ogle. Two witnesses say that you were doing that and that's
correct isn't it.
Yeah.
You can't dispute that. CCTV evidence shows a male, police have
identified as being you, walking in the group eh with four other
males walking towards Cluan Place before the attack and
returning afterwards and you're wearing similar clothing to a male
at the Albert Bar in previous CCTV footage and that this clothing
has never been recovered by police. Witnesses ...
Did you say sorry could you just, similar clothing to the male at
CCTV at the Albert Bar, is that from the CCTV at the.
Yes outside the bar.
Outside it, well it's not very clear surely like you're not saying that
that CCTV is clear that it shows what anyone's wearing.
I believe emm the hat sort of but yes and (inaudible}.
Dark clothing.
Dark clothing.

Emm hmm.
Witness evidence states the Seat Leon emm leaving the vicinity of
the murder with a number of persons present okay. Mobile phone
activity is consistent with you turning off eh your phone at
2056 hours after speaking to Jonathan Brown and turning it on
again at 2128 while walking along Frome Street towards your
home address in Wye Street and this is backed up with the CCTV
that I explained to you earlier about eh Jonathan Brown being in
the shorts and the hooded top okay and returning shortly after
being in your house with a bag okay. Why did you turn off your
phone at the.

But I would say it does cover it's the East Belfast area. Eh CCTV
evidence shows activity in the vicinity of 1 4 Wye Street after the
murder of Ian Ogle which is suggestive of a clean-up operation,
co-accused Jonathan Brown is seen entering at 1 4, sorry entering
1 4 Wye Street at 2222 hours after fleeing his home following the
arrival of police okay. Is that why he comes to your house.
No comment.
You know police are at his house quite quickly because of the
registration, so is that why your house becomes a, a clean-up
house.
No comment.
Right and left Adidas trainers that we talked about emm GE1 2 and
GE3 they are grey Adidas with the 3 navy stripes recovered from
1 4 Wye Street are similar to those eh worn by you on CCTV
footage close to the murder scene. Eh the images from CS6 that
we've talked about. Eh major DNA profiles from items GE2 and
GE3 matches the profile of yourself okay. You're also wearing the
same footwear in Russell's shop on the evenin·g of the 25th of
January 2019 the day before the murder. Isn't that correct.

Ok, this interview is being digitally recorded, it is being
conducted in an interview room at Musgrave Street Police

the interview room clock is 1645 hours. My name's Arlene

today is:

And can you introduce yourself.
MORRISON I'm Jill Morrison.
And Jill what's your date of birth.
MORRISON 16th of the 101h 82.
And the other person present.
SOLICITOR Julie Knight, Solicitor.
Ok. Eh Jill obviously you were arrested earlier on today and
that was in relation to attempting to pervert the course of
justice and assisting offenders and that's in relation to the
murder of Ian Ogle on Sunday the 2ylh of January 201 9 at
Cluan Place in Belfast. I'm going to caution you for those
offences in that you do not have to say anything but I must
caution you that if you do not mention when questioned
something which you later rely on in court it may harm your
defence, but if you do say anything it may be given in
evidence. All it means Jill is you don't have to speak to me in
this interview but should this matter, say maybe a lot of
months down the line end up being in a court and you bring
up something in court that you've had all those months to
think about and you didn't tell me today it will be up to the, the
judge, the jury and the court you know how much weight they
put on that new evidence that you're bringing then rather than
now. So basically what it's saying is just tell us today if you
can, ok.
MORRISON Ok.
Em say eh what I'm going to do is really just ask you then some
questions in relation to what em we have arrested you for, but
before I get into that there's just another wee spiel that I need to

say to you before we, we get into that and I'm just going to read
this out cause it's quite lengthy ok. So it says, we're now going to
ask you some questions about crime, no one should ever admit to
something that they haven't done or plead guilty to an offence they
haven't committed. If you're brou ght to court for this crime then
you can plead not guilty or you can plead guilty. If you plead guilty
when you're brought to court one of the things the court will look at
when passing a sentence is the time when you accepted your
guilt. The court will give credit to people who plead guilty at the
earliest reasonable opportunity in the proceedings. The court may
also give credit to those who admit they have committed the crime
they are being questioned about during police interviews. Making
admissions at interview may lead to a shorter sentence. Pleading
guilty at the earliest stage in proceedings may also lead to a
shorter sentence. Your solicitor can fully advise you on your rights
and if you wish to consult with them about what I've just said
please let me know.

No it's a number.
Ok and what's the number.
Sixteen, ten.
And there's no pattern on it. You know the way some people
would have like a swipe pattern.
No not that I can, I always just use my number sixteen, ten.
Ok so there's nothing else, ok. Em there was also a silver lphone
taken from your house eh it's black and white eh cover on it.
It was in the drawer.

was put to her.

because you know ehh you know Arlene's what Arlene's
saying is right, you know the police called to your house last
night and you had been with him, you'd been with him up to
that point and you know from what we can see you didn't help
us in any way you know try to, try to find where he was or tell
us where he'd gone or even you know point us in the right
direction as to who he'd be with.
MORRISON But I didn't know.
Mm hmm.
MORRISON So how could I help, how could I point you in a direction
where I don't know myself.
Mm hmm, mm hmm.
Whenever you had rang him and he said he's going to back in
five minutes, did he tell you where he was.
MORRISON No I didn't ask.
Or who he was with.
MORRISON No I didn't ask.
And was, how long would that call have lasted for.
MORRISON I have no idea.
Was it a long call, short call.
MORRISON It would have been a short call.
Obviously trying to locate Jonathan em so just want to ask
you again about his friends, eh you told us about em Glen
Rainey was it.
MORRISON Yeah that's, Glen and his friend Bo would be the only two
people that I would think that he would be friends with.
And who's Bo, what's So's other name.
MORRISON I don't know his real name.
Do you know where any of these people live.

couple of days.
Would it be anybody else that he would.
MORRISON Not that I know of no.
I mean do you know where he would be now.
MORRISON Right now.
Yeah.
MORRISON No.
You know he's in a hell of a lot of trouble like.

Yeah well you, well you kind of are.
MORRISON And.
He's not really helping you either you know.
MORRISON No exactly, I know.
I mean you know he's gone to ground at the end of the day
and if, if what you're saying is true that's fair enough but he's
not doing anything to help you.

home on a Saturday or not come home till Monday or
Tuesday like I would have to sometimes ring his mum.
Yeah.
MORRISON To see if he's there or I don't know where he goes.
This is a concern as well you know because he's bringing this
to your door as I said earlier on you know and he, he's
absolute, he's not, he doesn't seem to care at all that he's
done this, you know he hasn't told you, he hasn't rang you if
what you're saying to say look I'm in trouble here I'm going to,
I'm going to disappear for a couple of days if that's what
you're saying he hasn't, he hasn't give you any explanation.
MORRISON No none whatsoever.
To just shoot the breeze like this and not.
MORRISON I couldn't sit here and lie.
Mm hmm.
MORRISON And say that he told me where he was going or I knew where
he was going.
Yeah, this is different though in just disappearing for a few
days, you know he's got himself.
MORRISON But in my perspective is that's, that's how I would see it d'you
know.
Mm hmm, mm hmm.
MORRISON I don't know where he goes whenever he disappears for days
so I'm not going to know where, where he is now.
Mm hmm.
MORRISON Do you know what I mean like I was speaking to the police
last night and I was arrested at ten o'clock this morning. I

SOLICITOR I, I actually object to that line of questioning, I think it's highly
offensive to this suspect who actually put that sort of thing to
her.
Ok but.
SOLICITOR And you know that she's got a child waiting at home for her.
No, no absolutely, I totally, I don't and you know I'm not trying
to.
SOLICITOR And she is not, she does, she has answered the questions.
I'm not trying to cause, I'm not trying to cause any offence.
apologise if I've caused offence.
SOLICITOR You're asking her to speculate, how can she get her partner in
here when she's sitting being interviewed. She doesn't know
where he is.

Well that, that's why we're here talking right now.
MORRISON I have no phone.
Well you know we're trying to get to the bottom of it.
MORRISON Well I have no way of contacting him.
SOLICITOR If you focus your questions on the, the offences for which my
client is here.
MORRISON As soon as I phoned him and his phone was off I didn't try
and contact him again because like I've said it phone can go
off for two days and I wouldn't waste my time.
SOLICITOR
Well.
It doesn't help to make value judgements.
Ok so em Jill just to sort of the last things then that we're
going to look at is obviously phone records. We, we obviously
em have information eh in relation to phone calls. I'm just
going to show you these. Ok so eh on the 27th ok which is
Sunday em you ring him, eh lasts for about three seconds and
then another phone call, so one is at 2 1 20 and one is at 2127
and that lasts for about nineteen seconds, what was those
phone calls.
MORRISON Well this one here would probably have been ine asking him
where are you.
Mm hmm.
MORRISON This one here was obviously no answer and went onto
answer machine.
Ok.
MORRISON So this one would have been how long you going to be.
Mm hmm and that's the one for nineteen seconds and you're
saying then that's whenever em he says he's going to be
about five minutes.
MORRISON Mm hmm.

He's ringing you here, you know I think that's whenever the
police are there.
MORRISON Right.
And that's possibly cut off or whatever and as soon as police
go you're on the phone to him for one minute three seconds.
MORRISON Well I don't, don't, didn't speak to him after the police had left,
all I can think is I haven't knocked the phone off and it's a
voicemail.
Anything Claire.
No.
Eh.
MORRISON Cause I did say that I tried to ring him after the police had left.
Yeah you did say about three times and to be.
MORRISON No I says three times through the day.
To be honest with you Jill if that was my part in it police had
been there and.
MORRISON The first thing you're going to do is phone and see what the
heck's going on.
Absolutely.
I mean the whole street knows, you know everybody else
seems to be interested in what's going on and worried about
you, you know and the one person that's supposed to care.
MORRISON Love me and want to be with me doesn't want to know, I
understand that.
It's hard for us to accept you know that there hasn't been
some contact at some stage in the night.
And I can't believe J ill that if police are there you don't know
where he is that you wouldn't continually be trying to contact
him, my thought is you've got through to him and he's told you
what's gone on and that's why it's cut off at that stage.

that's in relation for attempting to pervert the course of justice
and assisting offenders and that's in relation to the murder of
Ian Ogle on the 2ih of January 201 9 eh at Cluan Place in
Belfast. Em this is the third interview em J ill, we've eh
conducted a couple of interviews with you. Just a couple of
wee things I just wanted to clarify with you before we continue
on. Em Jonathan whenever he went to the bar and before
you picked him up how did he get there.
MORRISON I took him there.
So you took him and where was his car at that stage.
MORRISON At my house.

interviews there we're just going to go through wh, what you
have told us and what we have an d em just to, to, to show
you you know the slight differences and why we believe that
you're lying to us basically. Obviously we showed you about
the phone call and that's, that's something certainly that
makes us believe that you're not telling us the whole truth and
of course it's within your best interest to tell us the truth.
Anything you want to say before we move on.
MORRISON No.
Ok so obviously you told us about picking Jonathan up and
you were at the, he was at the bar and then yous came home
and then he, you got the Chinese and you eat the Chinese,
took him back to the Albert Bar again and then you came
back home and then he leaves, but at 2121 hours eh Jennifer
Leahy rings you and we, we talked about that and you'd said
that she said something like it disgusting but there was no
lead up to that or anything that just seems to be and you
believed that that was in relation to Neil being drunk, is that
correct.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
Ok, eh, eh I don't accept that, I feel that's strange that that
would be just a conversation that you thought, is it the case
that Jennifer rang you to tell you what had happened to Neil.
MORRISON No she didn't ring me, she wrote a message saying that's
disgusting or it is disgusting.
And then you rang her.
MORRISON And I rang her.
Ok. Was that phone call for her to tell you what had gone on.
MORRISON About with Neil.
Mm hmm.
MORRISON Being attacked.

that's where he's left then, he has left in your car to go and
collect other people to go to find Ian and assault him.
MORRISON That, that's not what I know of.
MORRISON
MORRISON
And obviously this is a very, as we said earlier it's a very
brutal murder.
Mm hmm.
You know he was stabbed, he was kicked, punched, you
know it's, it's pretty horrendous what has happened to him.
Mm hmm.
And then he obviously your car's involved in this, this is your
car, so then the car is what we believe comes back to your
house.
MORRISON Yeah.
To the back of your house.
MORRISON Yeah.
And we believe that Jonathan or somebody else comes back
into your house and you're in the house, so I want you to be
honest with me and tell me did they come back, somebody
come back to your house.
MORRISON Yes Jonathan came back to my house.
Ok. So at what stage did Jonathan come back to your house.
MORRISON Before the police had arrived.

MORRISON Mm hmm.
Ok. Is that behind the driver's seaUpassenger seat.
MORRISON Mm hmm, eh well I don't actually remember which one it was.
Ok. So you put it in, were you curious what was in it.
MORRISON No I just did it.
Ok and then you moved the car.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
Where did you move it to.
MORRISON To where it is, to where it is.
Ok. So to be honest Jill I that, that for me's difficult you know
your partner comes in, goes up the stairs, gives you a bag
and moves the car, did he tell you to move the car.
MORRISON He asked me to.
Ok, did you ask him why.
MORRISON No.
So you must have had an idea something had gone down,
you know you must have had an idea that something bad had
happened then you know for, for you to not ask even.

MORRISON I never, I didn't, I didn't and I didn't know until this morning
and I was scared.
Ok, ok but last night were you scared when he came home
were you scared.
MORRISON No I'm not scared last night when he came home cause I
didn't know anything that had happened.
Ok.
And you weren't curious or wondered why he's asking me to
do this.
MORRISON No.
It seems strange Jill. You know that your partner comes in,
gives you a bag, he's a bit edgy, asks you to move the car
and you don't question it at all.
MORRISON Eh there wasn't even any time to question it.
Ok so how long was he in the house for.
MORRISON A few minutes.
Ok and what did he do then.
MORRISON Left.
Ok so you moved the car, did he tell you where to move it to.
MORRISON No.
Ok. So obviously then.
MORRISON I just moved it, if I was going to move it to be thinking I was
hiding anything I, I wouldn't have moved it just across the
street.
My difficulty is that you're moving a car you don't know why,
he's coming in possibly getting changed up the stairs, just tells
you randomly to put a, a bag into the back of the car, tells you
to move the car and you just do all this, you know you don't
ask why and also you know it's just very odd, it's just very odd
to me you know.

MORRISON After I had moved the car.
Ok, so you moved the car and this is sort of where did you
move it to again.
MORRISON Directly facing my gate.
Ok and is it like a.
MORRISON Cul-de-sac.
So it's covered sort of, did he tell you to move it there or.
MORRISON No.
Ok. So why, why there.
MORRISON I don't know.
Is that so it couldn't be seen.
MORRISON Well all you do is drive in.
Mmm cause it, it's obviously if you're moving the car you're
moving it for a reason so did you move it in there so as if
anybody was looking for it they wouldn't know where it was.
MORRISON I didn't think about it like that.
Do you not think it was unusual.
MORRISON Now say now yeah.
Has he ever asked you to do it before.
MORRISON No.
And was there anyone with him last night when he.
MORRISON No.

Cause you knew you had to go to the school the next morning
and you had to do the school run, you needed your car.
MORRISON Jonathan, Jonathan's car was there.
And do you have the keys for his car.
MORRISON His car (inaudible) house.
Well why did you not do the school run this morning then.
MORRISON Cause obviously the police had then came afterwards and
didn't want to go into Jonathan's car with the police looking for
him for then me to get stopped.
Eh that doesn't really make sense Jill, so,
MORRISON Well of course it does, why would I drive a car belonging to
somebody else if the police are looking for him.
Are you insured for his car.
MORRISON Yeah.
Ok, so even if the police stop you he's not in the car, you
know if the police are looking for him you know and they stop
you and they go well ok you're insured for that you, you know
there wouldn't be any reason to not to drive his car.
MORRISON No well I just didn't want to.
And why did you give him the keys back, eh give him the keys
of your car.

police came.

point of view where.
MORRISON No that's understandable.
And it's very easy for people to say oh I don't remember, I
don't know and I get it that you you know you're cautious
because of he's your partner and stuff and you don't want to
maybe say some things.
MORRISON And I was scared.
And you know you're saying that you're scared today and stuff
about, about things but we are in a different position and it's I
say as I'd said to you in the caution at the beginning you know
it's better tell us now cause if this matter ends up going to a
court and you bring up something in court.

then it's maybe shoes and clothing eh would you think or.
MORRISON I wouldn't say the bag was big enough for shoes and clothes.
Mm hmm. So you think there was shoes in the bag.
MORRISON Yeah.
Ok, em.
MORRISON And again at that time I did not know that anything had went
on. I didn't know that there was an assault or at that time
whenever I moved the car I did not know nothing until the
police came to my house and the police told me that
somebody was seen running with a knife and that was all I
knew.
Ok. Did there feel like anything else in the bag or.
MORRISON No I didn't, I didn't, I lifted it by the drawstring and.
So you lift it by the drawstring but you think it's maybe shoes.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
And did you wonder why he was giving you a pair of shoes to
put in the car.
MORRISON At the time no, I just, I don't know.
It would seem an odd thing.

MORRISON No I know and I get where, where yous are coming from but
I'm not in any way hiding where Jonathan is, I 'm not hiding the
fact that my car wasn't involved cause clearly now I do know
but at the time I was unaware of what was going on.
Ok, so you say then he gives you the bag, asks you to put it
into the car and to move the car, this is what you told me
yesterday and then you come back into the house and
handed him the keys.
MORRISON And I went upstairs.
And you said he left by the front door.
MORRISON Well I assume by the front door cause the police were out the
back.
But the police weren't there at that stage.
MORRISON There was a landrover in the street.
While he was in the house.
MORRISON Yes.
So I just, I just obviously that's new to me, so whenever em he
comes back into the house, back he comes back in your car,
comes into your house.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
How, where did you see the landrover.
MORRISON I was in the bedroom. After I moved the car I went up the
stairs.
So is that after he leaves or is that why he's there.
MORRISON He was downstairs.
Ok. So just to, to get our timings right here so.
MORRISON But that's what I'm saying I can't get my timings right because
it all happened so quickly. I don 't know what time he came,
what time he left, I don't even know what time the police came
at.

And why wou ld you think that he wou ldn't go out the back if there's a landrover.
MORRISON I don't know.
There m ust be a reason why you would think that. You know at that stage you don't think he's involved in anything or done anything wrong and you don't know about all this til l the next day why would you think he would fear going out the back.
MORRISON I don't know.
Cause there must have been something in your mind.
MORRISON Well he's just giving m e a bag to put in the car and asked me to move it and then a landrover drives in.
So what are you saying to me.
MORRISON So and then he leaves.

What I can tell you Gill is the, the white bag isn't in the car.

Well what sort of time then do you see the tent over the car.
MORRISON Whenever I woke up yesterday morning.
And what time was that.

MORRISON Mm hmm.
Ok did Jonathan tell you who was going to move the bag.
MORRISON No.
And did you give the keys to anybody to get into the car.
MORRISO N No.
Whenever you left the car did you lock the car or did you l eave it open.
MORRISON I have no idea.
Did Jonathan tell you to open, leave it open or l ock it.
MORRISON No. My automatic reaction would be to lock the car just by hilting the button bu t I can't recall whether I did or whe ther I didn't.

out round it so that nothing could happen to it.

And we understand that you know you, you, you did, you did said come in but you didn't go that additional bit by saying he's just left the house, he's probably round the corner or I can ring him and I think that's just all that we're trying to say is you didn't go that extra mile if you like. So what we're going to do is em just show you some CCTV em Jill. Eh this CCTV is from the back of your premises, em it looks out the back. Now it's, it's not all of it as we've just said earlier on you know there's a lot of CCTV trawling if you like, it's what we would call it as going on at the present. Takes a long time for people to view that and you know cause we're looking for specific things and em so basically CCTV you know we're, we're going to show you something here with cars and all but we will be looking CCTV on the Newtownards Road, we'll be following those cars and where they're going and you know maybe if they're go into a garage and you know people get out and so we, we, we're going to you know do as much as we can on that so this is just the very beginning if you like and it's just a small part but it's.

comes into view at 21 :37:07, so it's coming, you'll see it
coming in here and then you'll see one person getting out, the
lights are flashing as the car is locked up, so 21 :37:07 in a few
seconds. So here's someone coming in now. Now I'm just
going to pause it, this is where we believe your house is.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
Ok, so that car has parked just at the rear of your house and
you'll have to keep eyes very closely trained, someone's
getting out of the car, you can see the car door opening.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
MORRISON
And someone walking in, locking the car up and walking in ok.

where your house is and getting into that house. Now obviously we are talking to all your neighbours ok.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
An d we're ruling out that they have been getting any lifts.
MORRISON Yeah.
And so far nobody is saying that they left the house at that time of nig ht so.
We're pretty confident that's Jonathan coming out and getting in that car.
MORRISO N Right that's ok . All's I'm saying I didn't know that Jonathan got into a car.
Ok, so did you, did you, were you, did he say that he was going to leave with any one, that any one was coming to pick him up.
MORRISON No. I, I genuinely thought he left on foot. I said that in here, I did not.
What was your last conversation with him before he left the house.
MORRISON I don 't know cause, cause to be honest I thoug ht I had moved the car before he left.
Ok.
Eh if you watch the rest of the CCTV that will become clear here.
MORRISON Yeah but em that I did not know that he g ot into a car.
Ok. It's coming up in about 15 secon ds here or less than that. So you just see this light col oured car coming in, turning in from the rig ht, indicating right to drive in, it just reverses into Pitt Place, d o you know who's car that would be.
MORRISO N No.

Someone's walking out here.
No, we have our own car, he doesn't.
And then they get into.
I can't see when he comes out of the.
I know it's difficult to see.
The house.
Whene ver you're maybe far away but it eh you can see the figure just walking across behind this parked car in getting into, to the vehicle there and then that car drives up the Newtownards Road again and away.
Mm hmm.
And then the next footage then is what we think is you then reversing the car into Pitt Place and that was about three minutes later, so.
Does the other car go.
43:09, yes the other car's left then and it turns right onto the Newtownards Road and up drives up the Newtownards Road and obviously like we said you know we'll be getting the CCTV to trace that car coming in and leaving. You know there'll be city centre cameras, there'll be em business cameras, there'll be em footage, you know the way it goes, you know there'll be footage everywhere on the street.
That, that car there.

SOLICITOR Yeah.
Em.
SOLICITOR But what happens to that car does it stay there or does that
go away.
Oh this, oh sorry a coup, yes the couple that, that are parked
up here, yes sorry. They, I think they j ust turn their lights off
and they're still sitting there.
SOLICITOR Yeah and then what do they do.
I don't know actually, I haven't watch, I haven't watched that.
SOLICITOR Do they (inaudible).
Well that's obviously ongoing, em it's something that we don't

SOLICITOR Ok.
Cause you can see the, the lights still on.
SOLICITOR So do you see them getting out at any point.
I haven't, to be honest we've been too busy looking at this at the moment but we will be looking at this.
SOLICITOR Yeah.
Like I don't, you know every aven ue's going to be looked at, you know we will be looking at this car and seeing where it, where it comes from and who it belongs to too em and seeing if, I mean cause obviously they are witnesses so these will all be avenues that will, will be, will be bottoming out because at the moment obviously we're in, we're only on the second day of the investigation and these matters are all in hand. So you come out here and then you get into em the black car and that is.
That's you putting the lights on.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
As you open the car.
This is you here. So this is the, the Leon parked up here. This couple are still here and then you we'll see you reversing the car.
Did you notice them.
MORRISON I (inaudible), I don't reverse I just drive it round.

SOLICITOR Well how do you know it's a couple.
I think, I heard it upstairs that this was a couple in the car.
SOLICITOR Oh right ok.
So you know it's, it's probably the CCTV team have, have
seen it.
SOLICITOR So what time was the driving of the car.
So this is 21 :43:09 on the system but it would be in real time
21 :45, so it's a quarter to ten then that you're doing this and
then you can just see you coming back into the house after
you've parked the car up and then we don't see anyone
leaving or, or coming after that. So, you know, have you
anything to say about that, you know have you anything.
MORRISON No. I genuinely thought that Jonathan was in the house
whenever I put the bag in the car.
Mm hmm.
But that obviously isn't.
MORRISON Isn't true.
Isn't the case.
MORRISON Yeah.
Em do you need to see this again or anything.
MORRISON No.
You're happy enough. Em that obviously isn't the case Jill em
obviously Jonathan has gone and you know eh it's not really
any pressure or anything you know.

From him in the house going to you, right go and move that
car, go and do that, he's gone at that stage.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
So obviously the question to you is did you move that off your
own bat, you know did you know that that needed to be
moved cause he was in the house and said to you.
MORRISON If I knew that that had have been moved I wouldn't have,
would have moved it further than that.
But you have a eh, you have the child in the house so it's
unlikely you're going to drive too far leaving the child on her
own.
MORRISON But this is why I, I am, I could, I could have swore that
Jonathan was still in the house whenever I moved the car.
But that, that's obviously clearly from what we believe and
obviously there's going to be more CCTV.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
And we're going to be able to bottom that out hopefully a bit
better.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
SOLICITOR
Em but from our point of view at this stage that isn't the case,
Jonathan has left the house and.
Well are, are you sure that that is Jonathan going into the car.
Well that, well that's, that's what we're just saying that there's,
there needs to be more work done on that.
SOLICITOR Yes.
But from our point of view and what we believe is that that's
Jonathan cause you said there was nobody else in your
house.
SOLICITOR But you can't, the, the only thing is Arlene there is a possibility
obviously that that is not Jonathan and that it's somebody
coming from a different place not necessarily the house.

You believe he was in the house, you know there was no
conversation. So it's, it's you're what you're telling us is all
very bity you know eh the impression that.
MORRISON What I'm telling you is I did not assist anybody in doing
anything knowing what had happened.
But you, you have put the like of what you believe is maybe
shoes into the car, those shoes have gone, we need to see
whether that's involved in the murder you know so if, if that
turns out to be the case then you have moved those shoes,
you've moved the car that we do know has been involved
cause we know the people got into that car and was taken
away in that car and we know that that car has been brought
back to your house.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
And that that car belongs to you.
MORRISON Yeah.
So we need to bottom out really what your involvement in all
this is and to be honest with you Jill we think that your
involvement or your belief and your knowledge is far more
that you're ever telling us.
MORRISON I did not know that, that assault had taken place when I
moved that car, did not know.
So you, you can see that, that we, we need to piece it all
together.
MORRISON No I un, yes like I completely understand. Well at the time
whenever I moved the car I did not know that any assault had
taken place bar the one with Neil.
But you must have had some suspicion.
MORRISON Why.
Because your partner comes into the house, runs upstairs.

Comes down, hands you a bag with what you believe is shoes, says put them in the car, move that car, he goes out what we believe and you move the car and you, you, you must have thought something went on.
It's really unusual behaviour.
MORRISON It's, it's ok, it's ok saying saw it but I didn't know.
Yeah but you must have believed ii even if you didn't know that details, we believe that you probably do know more but even if you didn't you must have known that something major had gone on.
MORRISON No I didn't. I didn't know that not that anything had taken place, nothing at all.
Cause he never, he, you'd said he never comes back after that.
MORRISON What do you mean he never comes back.
He, he leaves and that's it, you said you didn't see him again after that.
MORRISON No cause the police were there then, the police were there not long after Jonathan had left.
But then obviously we believe then that you've phone him and that's something that we need to check you know was that a phone call, was that, did that connect to em you know the message service like you had sort of said, don't believe that's the case we believe that you have spoken to him said the police are here.
SOLICITOR Well that can be checked.
And that's all going to be checked .
MORRISON Mm hmm.
But that is, that's our belief at this time.
MORRISON But even whenever the police had came to my house I did not know. The police didn't tell me there was an assault, the police just told me that they were looking for Jonathan.

With other people or connect, no connect it with them the

And I'm interviewing, could you state your full name.
MORRISON Jill Morrison.
And the other person present is.
SOLICITOR Julie Knight, Solicitor.
Ok Jill em obviously this is our second interview today em and
that's in relation to em the murder of Ian Ogle which is alleged
to have occurred on or sorry which did occur on the Sunday
the 2?'h of January 201 9 and you were arrested for perverting
the course of justice and assisting offenders. Going to
caution you again for that offence in that you do not have to
say anything but I must caution you that if you do not mention
when questioned something which you later rely on in court it
may harm your defence. If you do say anything it may be
given in evidence. Obviously as well em Jill just prior to
coming in here you were further arrested for possession of
Class 'B' drug and you were cautioned for that offence as well
and eh we will ask you about that eh during this interview ok.
Em so eh obviously at the end of the last interview we, we
had covered eh just a few other things then that we need to
cover em in this interview. In the last interview we'd said to
you that the bag hadn't been recovered, the white bag that
you talked about, eh the JO Sports bag. Believe there was a
cursory search em done on the car and the bag wasn't
located at that stage so the information that I had at that time
was that the bag wasn't there. Subsequently em there has
been a more thorough search done of the vehicle and the bag
has been located ok. So.
SOLICITOR Can I just clarify when that search as actually carried out
because if you recall that the information was given yesterday
that the bag was placed in the back of the car.
Yes I.

SOLICITOR So and.
I don't have that information to the hand.
SOLICITOR Well that, that is something that em you know that the
information that I would like to receive em after the interview.
Well I say at this stage I, I don't have it, em I imagine it was
probably today but I'm not going to say that because I'm not
honestly sure.
SOLICITOR Yes.
Em so Jill in that bag em there was a pair of grey and navy
Nike trainers, male's trainers, do they belong to Jonathan.
MORRISON Yeah.
Yeah so are they trainers that he would normally have or h.
SOLICITOR Have you got the trainers.
I don't have them with me.
SOLICITOR Em because em the, the only, I mean I want to be, so in order
to be correct em then if you haven't actually got the trainers
that are in the bag you'd be asking does he have actually a
pair of trainers that match that description.
Yes eh and you're saying and you're saying that he does.
SOLICITOR (inaudible).
MORRISON He has, he has quite a lot of trainers.
And obviously we can't bring you those trainers cause those
trainers need to be tested.
SOLICITOR (inaudible).
Obviously we believe that those trainers are likely to be
involved in the murder and em as I'd said to you eh Ian was
badly assaulted and stamped on so we need to check those
trainers for DNA and for blood and for all of those things. Em
but you, you're saying that he does have a pair of trainers that
match that description.

Yeah you'd said you believed they were in trainers but he's

Armour one.

would have a hat that matches that description.
MORRISON No. I don't associate myself with Jonathan's friends.
Did you see Jonathan wearing a hat on that evening.
MORRISON No.
MORRISON
MORRISON
On Sunday evening. There's also in the bag a substantial
amount of money found, thousands of pounds, now I can't
give you exact amount at this stage but a substantial amount,
where did that come from.
I don't know I was handed the bag.
Ok, do you, was the money discussed.
No. The contents of the bag weren't discussed.
Did you know there was money in it.
MORRISON No.
And do yous keep a lot of money or a lot of cash in your
house.
MORRISON Not really, Jonathan's a tiler and sometimes he gets paid in
quantities of money and I would put it into the bank for him.
Would he generally be paid in cash.
MORRISON It just depends on his job, on the job in question that he's
doing.
Em so I say you tell me you have no knowledge of that money
or where that came from.
MORRISON No.

When did he come in.
MORRISON I don't know what time it was.
Was it after police, before police.
MORRISON After police, I was in bed.
Ok, so tell me about that, just, just describe and tell me what
happened.
MORRISON He just knocked the front door and asked was I alright.
And what did you say.
MORRISON Not really.
And did he come into the house.
MORRISON He did come in.
Ok, because what we know is that Jonathan had betweeli
1 1 .30 and midnight had made several calls to Thomas and
obviously we don't know the content of those calls but he has
rang Thomas and then we find a car key that you say isn't
there belonging, well we haven't checked that yet, but a car
key which.
MORRISON It wasn't in my possession.
It isn't in your, well it wasn't in your house.
MORRISON Right.
Bui it's a possibility then that Thomas has this key. How did
Thomas get the key.
MORRISON I have no idea.
Ok, did you give it to him.
MORRISON No.
Because as I said to you Jill I find it strange that you just
came back and handed it to eh Jonathan whenever he wasn't
going to take your car.

Well he was leaving but he didn't seem to be going out the

MORRISON You don't need to go out the back to take the car you can
walk round the front.
But you said he had possibly had gone out the front.
MORRISON Yeah.
And we know that the car didn't go.
MORRISON Right.
So did you, was there arrangements made between Jonathan
and Thomas for Thomas to come into your house to get that
key.
MORRISON I have no idea.
Are you aware whether eh Jonathan gave the key to Thomas.
MORRISON I hadn't been speaking to Jonathan.
And are you aware of the circumstances, do you know that
whether Thomas was asked to get rid of the bag in the car or
to get rid of your car.
MORRISON No I've no idea.
Cause what I think is eh that Jonathan has rang Thomas to do
that and either you've believe that he has come into your
house, you've gave him the key but the police and all had
been there so he didn't get that opportunity to remove that.
MORRISON So why did the police not take the key.
We think then that the key you have given it to Thomas.
Cause you told us.
SOLICITOR Sorry you've just said a moment ago that eh you thought that
Johnathan had rang Thomas em to do it and that you'd given

him the key but he, he didn't get the opportunity of doing that
because the police were there.
Well the police then are obviously with the car and at your
house but they.
SOLICITOR Getting the key (inaudible)
MORRISON (inaudible).
SOLICITOR I, I'm not sure what you're putting to her.
What I'm putting to you is that the key wasn't in your house
whenever police come, according to you, you said the key
wasn't there.
SOLICITOR But that's right.
Yes.
SOLICITOR The key wasn't there.
So had you at some stage given that key then to Thomas.
MORRISON When.
At any stage.
MORRISON No.
Ok. I know you're saying it's after the police but I have to,
I've, I've only your word for that.
MORRISON No that.
It could have been before.
SOLICITOR She, she said categorically that she didn't give the key to
Thomas.
And that's fair enough and that's what I'm asking.
SOLICITOR But you've just said, you said it was after the police.
No she said it was after the police.
SOLICITOR No she didn't say that she gave the key to him.

If, if that's not clear, sorry about that Jill, so what I'm saying is
whenever em you move the car, I say there, there is phone
calls from Jonathan to Thomas and we believe that's to try
and get rid of either the car or the items in the car.
MORRISON Right.
Em Thomas has obv, or Jonathan has obviously left so what
I'm asking you is did you give the key to Thomas to get rid of
those items.
MORRISON No.
Ok. Are you aware whether Thomas has your key for your
car.
MORRISON No.
Ok and are you aware that anybody gave that key to Thomas.
MORRISON No. I have, I didn't leave the house or speak to anybody.
And what would have been the reason for Thomas to have
that key.
MORRISON I have no idea.
Anything there Claire.
No.

something in court that you could have quite easily told us
today it would be up to the court how much weight they put on
that, ok. So as I say you are just back today and em it's really
em just then to eh talk about eh what has happened again.

heard in the community that you feel would be of use to

phone call and you'd said that em that Jonathan had been
had gone by that stage.

you thought that there was trainers in it.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
And you had put it in the back then of the car.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
And you moved the car.
MORRISON Yeah.
Em that Jonathan has asked you to do. Em so we covered

would normally wear sh, grey shorts.

he has gone out.

And then he, he comes back in and asks you to move the

whenever he left the house.
MORRISON I didn't know, I don't look at him like that d'you know, I didn't
know anything had happened, I wouldn't have any reason to
be looking to see what he was wearing, d'you know he always
wears grey.
And I know what, what we had said to you Jill was that we
were going to obviously we put some CCTV and things to you
and we'd further CCTV to do you know and to look at.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
And em from what we can see your account had been that he
had come in and then em you believed that he left through the

MORRISON Mm hmm.
And because you believed that there was em a police
land rover.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
Al the back em so what we can say is that your, I know we

Because he does leave out the front door.
MORRISON Right ok.
And he does have on grey shorts and a hoodie.
MORRISON Righty oh ok.
So would that be what he was wearing.
MORRISON Well he, eh he would get changed into shorts to sit about the
house, d'you know he wouldn't sit about in jeans or d'you
know so like eh it would be he probably had shorts on.
Ok. So from our point of view we can see him leaving out the
front, so we're satisfied enough at that and it's only right that
you know that cause we had put the possibility of another em
scenario to you.
MORRISON Yes (inaudible).
So we, we were content, now because we said.
MORRISON Well that's ok.
MORRISON
MORRISON
MORRISON
To you you know there's a lot more work to be done.
No I understand that completely.
A lot more CCTV. So that's where we are in relation to that.
You had gone out, put the car away, police seem to arrive and
then he seems to go out the front as you had said initially.
Mm hmm.
Em so that, that's the scenarios. So then he em obviously
leaves, do you know where he went then.
No I've no idea.

MORRISON Yeah.
Eh this is how she describes it.
MORRISON Righty oh, ok.
I don't, I don't know, I can't, I can't speak for her, but anyway
so she took them from secure storage and she brought the
keys into the car park at Ladas Drive em where the Seat
Leon, registration JGZ 7406 was parked and she says the
keys opened the vehicle. So basically she's tried to open the
vehicle with the key. It's just to make sure that these keys
that were taken from em the house eh Thomas' house match
up with your car and then she, she opens the car, happy and
satisfied that these are the right keys to open that vehicle and
then she returns the P H 1 back to secure storage. So we're
satisfied that the keys that were in Thomas eh McCartney's
house were the keys that em open your car and you don't
have the keys and you said.

SOLICITOR I thought it was somebody allegedly getting into some silver car which you assumed was Jonny.
At the be, the beginning of the interview there (inaudible).
SO L ICITOR Yeah is there more CCTV now.
But that's what I was saying to Jill at the beginning of this interview, I've clarified that that obviously em there is more CCTV and we've as, as Jill has said.
SOLICITOR Right, I wasn't in the first in, set of interviews.
No sorry.
SOLICITOR So I ' m at a bit of a disadvantage.
Yeah I understand , so it was just in this interview today that's what we're discussing.
SOL ICITOR Right ok.
And I was just saying to Jill that there are parts you know what Jill had told us in the first interview.
SOLICITOR Right ok yeah.
Are matching up.
SOL ICITOR Yeah.
You know and that, that's fair enough. So em whenever we get to em see the CCTV then em as I say that, that's the stage we just sort of say that again is that you come into the house, you've sent the, put the car into the cul-de-sac, you come in in your account and give those keys to Jonathan and he leaves the house, that's what you told isn 't that right.
MORRI SON Mm hmm.
So em that's fair enough, yeah that' s your account and he leaves the house but from the CCTV Jonathan leaves the house so he doesn' t go to Thomas McCartney's house ok, so he doesn't go there.
MORRI SO N Well I don't know where he went cause I was in the house.

I know you don't.
MORRISON Right ok.
But what I would say was that if he has the keys, the key to
your car and if Thomas McCartney has it there's only two
people could give Thomas McCartney the key, it's either
yourself or Jonathan alright. So Johnathan leaves the house
and doesn't go to Thomas' house ok, so he doesn't do that,
he goes on ahead. The next thing then at about twenty to
eleven, somewhere around there, Thomas comes to your
house.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
And then Thomas leaves.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
Now what we know is that Jonathan had made contact with
eh Thomas McCartney a short time before by phone.
MORRISON Oh right.
And he rings him and we believe then that is for him to come
into your house to collect the key so as he can get rid of the
vehicle but in the mean time as we had told you was that the
police were there before he got that opportunity to do that. So
what I'm saying to you Jill is that Johnny Brown didn't give
him the key and the only person left's you to give him the key.
MORRISON So the car key couldn't have been put through a fence.
Well tell me if it was.
MORRISON I don't know I was in the house.
But how would it have been put through a fence.
MORRISON Cause Jonny went out the front.
Yeah but that's what I'm saying we've CCTV out the front, he
walks straight out of the house and away, he.
MORRISON Right so I've a porch this size.

MORRISON So the key could have been on the floor, the key could have been, I didn't have the key.
Well from our point of view there's only two people could have had it and it's Jonathan, he comes straight out of the house, there's no, doesn't appear to be any fiddling about or anything, comes straight out of the house.
MORRI SON So can I say that if I have a porch that my front door opens in the way there's CCTV directly looking into my house.
No it's looking down the street.
MORRI SON Right so you wouldn't see that.
Wouldn't.
MORRISON Inside my porch.
No you, you wouldn't see inside the porch but what we can see is him.
MORRISON So what I'm saying is if I did, if I, if I don't have the key and Jonny has the key and you're telling me that Jonny and Thomas have had connection.
Yes.
SOLICITOR How do you not know Jonny give Thomas the key after he left her house.
That's what I'm saying it's CCTV.
SOLICITOR He mightn't have gone, he mightn't have gone, cause you're saying Thomas' house is the other direction.

MORRISON It's next door.
Yes but that's towards the Newtownards Road.
MORRISON Mm hmm.
And then it's on up. He comes up, he doesn't go past, he
doesn't go past eh Thomas' house he comes the other way.
SOLICITOR He goes the other way.
(inaudible).
SOLICITOR I know eh.
So he comes out and straight down and then a short time
later obviously he's in your house, Thomas is in your house
but Jonathan had rang him a couple of minutes before em
before he goes into your house. So basically Jonathan rings
him, a few minutes later he goes into your house and when
police search his house your, the keys there because police
had already been there so he didn't have an opportunity to
move the car.
MORRISON Eh I told yous that.
Told me what.
MORRISON That the police were at the car.
Yeah and we've talked about that and that's what I'm saying
you know that shows that, we know that but he didn't, he
wasn't able.
MORRISON So you're, so you're saying that I'm giving somebody a key to
move a car and I know that the police are out there.
But there's always that possibility that you're hoping that the
police will go or that you didn't want the key to be in your
house and that's why I'm asking you to tell me, is it a case
that you just didn't want the key to be in your house whenever
the police if the police came searching your house and.
MORRISON But the police were already in my house.

MORRISON I know but that's not you, you know so and.
Yeah I know and I would imagine.
SOLICITOR Yeah well that's, that's exactly the point.
Yeah, yeah.
SOLICITOR I was saying to you earlier depends on the nature of the
relationship you have with someone, if the nature of the
relationship is an equality relationship, an equal relationship,
you say to somebody why are you asking me to do that, if it's
not and you're some kind of lesser relationship where
somebody is effectively dictates to you and tells you what to
do and if you, if you'd said to her for example I said to her if
he'd said to you away up and get me a chippy and up the
chippy and get me a fish and chip would you have done that
and she said yeah I would have done that.
But is, is that the case does he tell you to do stuff and you just
do it.
MORRISON Eh, eh,
You cause what he's saying, eh sorry Mr Shannon.

MORRISON If he says going to the chippy, I think I'm hungry do you want
go, go and grab some food yeah then I'll go but it's not like.

Yeah, cause what you'd said even eh earlier on in the night
was that em he wanted to stay out a bit longer.
MORRISON And I told him no.
And yous had, yous had a bit of a , bit of a fall out about that
because you're like no.
MORRISON Yeah and he wasn't happy.
So I don't get that impression that he just tells you to do stuff
and you just do it. I imagine.
MORRISON No it wouldn't be tell, tell you it as in like oh go and do this, or
go and do that, you know what I mean it's do you fancy going
or d'you know depends on how you word it.
Yeah, so that, that's what I ' m asking you know, I , I imagine if
you've you know you've a bit of barney earlier, you're not
staying out, you know there's not then you're not the total
walk over that you know would just, somebody will say to you
put that in the car and you go ok and move the car, ok and I'm
going now, ok, I just don't get that impression from you Jill
that you would you know that you wouldn't say to somebody
listen what am I don't that for, what's the reason, why are you
doing, why are you going out of this house again, what's
going o n , police are out the back, what is happening, I just
don't get that impression.
MORRISON No which is why later on I told you that once the police had
left I asked him what was going on.
And what did he say.
MORRISON He didn't a nswer.
So you're saying he told you absolutely nothing.
MORRISON Absolutely nothing. I did not know nothing, I didn't know
nothing had happened.
But you m ust have been suspicious.
MORRISON Being suspicious and knowing something is obviously

round up of, of what has gone on. So Jonathan comes back
into your house, he goes up the stairs, he comes down the
stairs with that bag, the white bag with the drawstring, you
think that there's trainers in it, em turns out there's a hat and
two thousand pounds in it. He comes in, he gives you that,
tells you to put that in the car and to move the car, you do
that. Jonathan leaves the house and we see him leaving the

admit their guilt in a police interview will usually receive a lesser
sentence than those who wait until later. If you tell us is this
interview that you accept you've committed a crime that you're
being questioned about the Public Prosecution Service will have
your case dealt with as quickly as possible but you should never
plead guilty or admit to something you have not done and you're
presumed innocent until proven guilty. Your solicitor em can fully
advise you on your rights and if you wish to consult with him about
what I've just said please let me know. Is that clear enough for
you. Em and, and basically that's exactly right what it says and
the point of an interview is just to get is to get your account.
You're here today, you've been arrested on suspicion of two
offences and really what we, we, we just get your account, that
does not mean you're guilty it means we want an account from
you eh and if you can explain your whereabouts, you can explain
any involvement or any knowledge that you have em or give alibis
or whatever we can check that out em and it's deemed that
obviously you, you know you're innocent of this then you know
we'll deal with deal with that as, as it goes and that, that's really
what the interview process is. Ok so em basically just ask you at
the outset of the interview obviously we're here to speak about the
murder of Ian Ogle ok which em Ian was attacked em some time
around twenty, in and around twenty past nine yesterday evening
ok. Em so I'm just going to ask you first of all do you know
anything about the attack on Ian Ogle.
No.
My client's asked me to read out a statement on his behalf as well.
Ok.
Em I'm read it into the record and give it to you as well.
Certainly, yes.
I'll give you a copy of it.
Of course.
Says I Thomas McCartney, date of birth 18th of the 4th 87, aware
that I am under caution, deny that I, deny that I was involved in the
murder of Ian Ogle or that I have perverted the course of justice or
assisted any of fender involved in the murder. On Sunday the 2ylh
of the 1 st 19 I was with my partner and five of our children at her
home address at 1 Wolf Close, Belfast. I had stayed there on
Friday and Saturday night. On Sunday I didn't leave the house at

any stage other than to have cigarettes in the garden. During the day I watched the Rangers/Livingston match at 3pm, I then had dinner and then watched the Chelsea FA Cup match. I watched the matches with children, my partner, Ashleigh Neil was also in the house, she left the house just after 5pm to get things for dinner and the childrens' breaks at school. She returned to the house around fifteen to twenty minutes later and was in the house for the rest of the evening. After the Chelsea match I watched em Black Panther on Sky Movies. The kids were put to bed around 9pm. After the kids eh went to bed we watched the remainder of Black Panther in the bedroom. The first I heard of anything eh to do with Ian Ogle was when my sister Danielle McCartney texted my partner, Ashleigh, she told her in an exchange of texts on Facebook that Ian had been stabbed to death. I think the police had arrived to search Ashleigh's neighbour's house just prior to that text being received. I don't know if they were searching the house but they were present at the front and rear of the house. I have not assisted anyone in relation to the murder of Ian Ogle either before or after it occurred. I didn't get to sleep until sometime after 2pm due to police activity outside the house. I woke up at 6am this morning and got up at 6.30am, I went to Shop4U on the Newtownards Road but it wasn't open so eh went to the Mace to get gas top up card and bus card top up for the child for school. I went home and got ready for work and left the house around 7 .1 0am to go and get the bus into the city centre. Em I went straight to work and remained there until contacted about police wanting to speak to me. At no time did I pervert the course of justice or assist any offender nor do I know who was involved in the murder of Ian Ogle and it's signed Thomas McCartney and dated 28th of the 1st 19, now obviously I asked at the start of the interview about perverting the course of justice.
Yes, yeah.
Because whilst there were other thing clarified to me but the custody record by the sergeant that aspect sorry.
Right.
And hadn't been discussed with him.
Ok so in any, any rec.
Em but I can take further instructions from my client anyway in regards to that.
Certainly.

I don't.
Is there anything you're aware of that could help us to find the people.
McCARTNEY No.
Who are involved in, in killing him because obviously that's not why you're sitting here today, I mean nobody's saying that you know you have killed him or stabbed him or anything like that but em obviously we're trying our best to, to get to the route of who did do it. Em but I'm just going to give you a wee bit of the background as to what happened last night, just to paint the picture for you a wee bit. Em so eh basically em Ian and his son, Ryan Johnston, don't know if you know Ryan do you. You're nodding your head to say.

he has been asked for his movements em from Sunday tea-time .
Yes.
So after his movements from prior to the event.
Yes.
To after, to.
Ok.
To the time of his arrest with a view to eliminating him I suppose is
the, is the issue.
Well and.
So it's still he's still alive.
Well also to establish who you were in contact with, were you
involved in any potential planning of this eh incident, was there
you know how premediated was it, was there prior planning, was

then gone on to commit this, this mur, this murder, is there
anything you can tell us at all about who you were speaking to last
night.
McCARTNEY No.

Because again I've given you our susp1c1on and it's very early

on Neil Ogle.
And I've already had it in that there that I have had no contact or

reference so for what's h, what's happened after and you know is
linked to it but it could turn out down the line that that actually had
nothing to do with it and that this was something completely
unrelated so that's why we need you to explain to us any, any
contact you had em.
I had none.
lphone or (inaudible), right ok. Em and I appreciate you came,
you didn't bring your phone with you to the station today, em do
you have a phone.
Yeah.
Ok. Em and if you can think back to yesterday evening could you
tell us who you were in contact with.
Yesterday.
Yeah.
No response.
I mean you don't make any comment if you don't wish to.
Eh no comment cause I don't even.
Ok, ok, well what we do know for fact is that em this assault
happened around twenty past nine at Cluan Place, em Ian's home
address, are you familiar with, with that address are you.
Yeah I think everyone in East Belfast is familiar with Cluan Place.
Ok but you know his exact house do you, I think it was number 4.
McCARTNEY No.
You wouldn't have known his house.
McCARTNEY No.
OK well we believe it's happened there. Em so twenty past nine

That's correct, yes that's my understanding yes. Em but w, will
still say you're on susp, you're here on suspicion of an offenc e,
there's nothing to say that you've actually committed any offences
at this point but this is why we just want your explanation em as to
what you were doing, who you were with and again yes as your
solicitor pointed out to potentially eliminate you from our en quiries
if, if you aren't connected in any shape or form but obviously our
fo cus is on getting who is responsible for this em violent attack on
Ian and if anyone can help us in any way to identify these people
em then that will obviously you know assist the investigation. Em
and if you've had a conta ct with people in the aftermath of it there
is a potential then that the people have passed on information
about what has just happened em or that they were in, in contact
with you in the run up to it and it is our suspicion that you have
some knowledge of who was involved in this attack.
And, and you're saying that that's because you have information to
suggest that there's telephone contact with one or more persons
but we don't know what time (inaudible).
Correct I, I believe so, cause yes it's phone records which we'll
have in more detail all being well at a, at a later date but em so
that, that's the basis of why you are here, so it, it's up to yourself
obviously if you want to.
I know Thomas it only happened last night it's not like we're asking
you about a phone call three weeks ago. You know surely you
remember if somebody rang you last night or any call.
You see when you've five kids running about the house it's a bit
hard like to keep tra ck of what you actually all do unless you're
actually sitting doing nothing.
Yeah you know I appreciate that but obviously a major incident
happened last night so if somebody, that's another thing I was
going to get to you know you said that you found out about this
through your girlfriend's sister or something.
No my sister.
Your, your sister.
My sister text.
What, what was, what was the content of that, what exa c tly were
you told.

Just in relation to.
Ok.
Police, police didn't seek.
My sister, my sister is good friends with Ian's daughter.
Right.
Police didn't seek.
And mixed with her half the night with her.
Police didn't seek to ask my client on a voluntary basis for any
information.
That's correct.
So what is the evidence that he has been withholding that
information from you.
Well.
If it, it was never asked for what's the basis of it being withheld.
Well it's you know it's the fact that we believe he's been in contact
with somebody that's been involved in this so we are giving him an
opportunity to tell us if he has.
But, but, but what you're saying is, but what you're saying is that it
is withholding information.
Potentially.

And the, the two can go hand in hand in fact that.
Bui they're different offences.
Different offences certainly they are and if you are connected to
assisting offender the potential is that you have. some information
about an offence that you haven't come forward to police to pass
over. So that's the link really that you haven't.
No, no, no that's not true because assisting offender is not you
know an omission is not the is not the assisting you know.
Well we don't know that's it just an omission, we don't know that.
Yes but with, with, with, with the example you gave there is, is an
omission.
No, no I'm saying there's the potential.
Well I'm asking what is the question.
We, we don't know.
We haven't even got to the assisting offender yet.
We don't know.
This is a live investigation and obviously you know this is at this
stage.
It is yes, it is but it is and that's my point, my point is, my point is
that it's a live investigation, you've asked my client about
withholding information but you've never actually sought any
information off my client so how can he have been withholding
information from you whenever you never actually sought any
information from him.

We'll just go to the last call then just em is at midnight 01 ,
000 1 , on the 28th and it's another call Johnathan Brown to
yourself for twenty seconds on that occasion. So basically the
culmination of those six calls em is just under six minutes, em
which is a reasonably long time in phone chat terms.
McCARTNEY Right.
Albeit they're broken down into shorter calls. It seems very
strange when you, yous tell us that you don't have any.

Conversation or any contact with him on a day to day basis
that you suddenly become the person that he's nearly

wants to speak to you , he's phoned you five times, you've
phone him once and there's been a couple of texts or
attempted texts. That, that's, that's why we're in a difficult

persons who we want to speak to about this murder.
McCARTNEY Yes and I don't have a clue about it.
And you're, you're being spoke, they're trying to contact you
after they've just killed somebody, so the logical mind would
think that they're ringing about that or in connection with that
in some shape or form and that they've either been asking
you to assist them to do something or they've been saying are
the police outside my house, is ii safe for me to come home,
are the police there. Is that something that.
McCARTNEY No.
That was said to you.
McCARTNEY I wasn't even speaking to him and haven't been speaking to
him.

McCARTNEY But how could I tell you if I didn't know I had them.
Well so you're saying.
You say you don't know but ii seems, it'd be seen strange that
there's six minutes of calls almost on, on your phone that you
can't account for and they're all from this Johnathan Brown
guy and even on one occasion you try and ring him back. So
if there's some reason eh you're protecting somebody in
some shape or form and you just don't want to.
McCARTNEY No.
To be in trouble for telling the police where they are, what
they've been speaking to you about.
McCARTNEY Why would I.
So that's not the case.
McCARTNEY I'm just saying no there is no case there.
You, you, are you trying to protect Johnathan Brown for any
reason.

There's, there's a lot of hoops, there's a lot of hoops to jump
threw to get, to get people's details, phone traffic, it's not just
a case we can just ask for anybody's. Em there's an officer
assigned who's making separate applications for every single
eh phone in the enquiry and they will then be going to a
specific Telecom Liaison unit em that will decide and consider
human rights and everything and will give an accurate, well
eh, well then decide whether we have grounds to apply for it
in the first place and will approve the application and the
application will then be sent on once it's approved to be it 02,
Vodafone or whatever and they will come back with the
details. Em I know I appreciate it's quite basic looking in this
format but em it will come in more detail at a later date with
cell sites and, and things like that em.
And, and providers at the minute we don't know who the
actual providers are.
And providers yes. This, this is basic but all I can tell you is
there's an officer assigned who's making these applications
and he's satisfied enough that this is Johnathan Brown's
number em and he's been able to attribute it to Johnathan
Brown and that the application has been able to get through
because.
SOLICITOR How do we, right he has obviously attributed that to
Johnathan Brown.
Yes.
SOLICITOR Prior to Jill confirming it is that.
Eh I don't believe so police weren't.

SOLICITOR
You know we made a link to the vehicle involved in this
enquiry em last night, eh it's quite early on after the incident.
Like I said to you the police were first at number 3 at ten thirty
last night so that's an hour afterwards ok so enquiries would
have been made with Jill at that point em and contact was
made, efforts were made to try and contact Johnathan Brown
at that point em and it was ongoing, police were back and
forth from that house, eh 2230, 2251 , em 231 5 and then it
was only this morning that TSG and the search went in and
she was actually arrested, eh but there was numerous eh
attempts to track him down. So I believe that is when his, his
phone number was em accessed or given to police by Jill at
that point.
Ok but you're saying that's not evidence at this stage and I'm
still not sure of the provenance of it. I'm, I'm not saying it's no
correct.
Yes.
I'm unsure of the provenance of that.

okay, you understand that okay. You understand that okay.
