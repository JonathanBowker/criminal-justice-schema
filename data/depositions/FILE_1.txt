The accused has the right to inspect every exhibit either by himself or in consultation with his solicitor or any witness the accused may wish to call at his trial. 
The accused may at the inquiry make a submission that the holding of a preliminary inquiry would be contrary to the interests of justice and the court shall consider any such submission before deciding to hold such inquiry. 
The accused may object to the admission of any statement tendered to the like extent as in the case of oral evidence and may require any person, whether his statement is tendered in evidence or not, to attend and give evidence at the inquiry. 
Where the accused will require any witness whose statement of evidence is served together with this notice to give oral evidence at the preliminary inquiry it is desirable in order to avoid any adjournment of the court that I be so informed a reasonable time before the commencement of the inquiry by writing to me at the following address 
Director of Public Prosecutions Belfast Chambers, 93 Chichester Street, BELFAST, BT! 3JR 

so that I can secure the attendance of the witness at the court at the time of the inquiry.

I am the girlfriend ofRyan Johnston, we have been together for 3 years. I live with Ryan and his parents, Ian and Vera. At the beginning of July in 2017 Ryan was in a bar called The Albert on the Albe1tbridge Road; he was along with his friend called Andrew Gunning who is also known as "Google". Ryan has told me that he had been standing beside the DJ box, the DJ had wanted out and Ryan "tapped" a fella called "Saucey" on the shoulder to get him to move and let the DJ out but Saucey hadn't liked this, he wasn't happy but I think Ryan just walked away. That bar is mn by the UVF and later that night Saucey was going round taking money offpeople for a "lock in". As'he was going round he accused Ryan of giving him dirty looks; Ryan asked him what he was talking about and the next thing he knew he was attacked from the side by Jonny Brown, both him and Saucey stamped all over Ryan and gave him a real beating. A massive fight broke out and the bar got wrecked. Ryan's sister Toni was in another bar nearby and she was nmg to say that he was getting a beating; both she and her dad went to the Albert and joined in the fight. Ryan got bottled during the fight and had to get 6 staples in his head. Ryan's second cousin, Neil Ogle, was there; he is UVF too but he didn't support Ryan that night and there has been bad blood

Page 2 of 4 between them since then. Ian and Ryan got blamed for wrecking the bar. He was told they had to pay money or else something would happen to them. As in they would put the whole family out. Ian and Vera payed �500 but that didn't seem to change anything, they were still getting threats. Ryan and his Daddy were actually ordered to come down for a punishment beating around a year ago. I think they wanted to break Ian's arms and then for him to watch Ryan being beaten. They refused to go down and the UVF didn't like that; Ian and Ryan were constantly looking over their shoulder. Someone called Greg tried to run Ian over one day outside Keen's furniture shop, Ian told me this himself. He said the guy was revving the engine and told him he would put him over the bonnet. Ian used to work in a factory in N ewtownards but he had to give it up because they knew his routine; he didn't really leave the street because of the threats against him. On Sunday 27th January 2019 myself, Ryan, Vera and Ian went up to Toni's house in Ballyhackamore; we went up for our dinner at 4 o'clock, they also wanted to watch the Rangers match which started around then. Toni's patiner, Gatih Walker was also there with his son Troy (12 yrs). I drove us all there in my silver Ford Fiesta 11111111111111.We had our dinner and left to go home around 8.30 pm. As we were driving along the Beersbridge Road Ryan saw Neil up ahead, he was a good distance away but Ryan knew that it was him by his walk. Neil was up ahead walking on the pavement in the same direction as us. I was stopped at a set of traffic lights, Ryan whispered to me "there's Neil". Ian and Vera were in the back of my car, he probably didn't want his mummy to hear. The lights changed and I drove on but Ryan asked me to let him out so I pulled in in front of a row of shops on the opposite side of the road; the same side that Neil was walking on. Ryan jumped out of the car and went up to him, I was still trying to park my car so I don't know if anything was said but they statied fighting, both of them were hitting each other. I got out of the car and on over to them but then I stopped, I didn't know what to do. My car has only 3 doors, I could hear Ian shouting to be let out, he was sitting in the rear behind the passenger seat. Vera was on the back beside him and Ryan had been in the front with me. I went back to my car and lifted the seat forward to let him out. He started hitting Neil as well, it was only a couple of punches. Ryan had Neil by the hair, he was saying to him that he was family but that he hadn't helped him that night in the bar. There were quite a few passers by who stopped, I don't know who any of

Page 3 of 4 them were. Yesterday Ryan was wearing a green Northern Ireland football top, black Under Atmour shorts with grey Under Atmour leggings under them. I can't remember what Neil was wearing but at one point his shoe came offand I noticed that it was a grey Adidas and he was wearing a hat with a porn porn on top. The rest of his clothing was just dark coloured. The fight just seemed to fizzle out, Neil walked away in the direction of his house; he was hunched over and was on the phone. I could see his patiner at the window of their house. I shouted after him "go and get your fucking cronies", I just knew when he was on the phone that he was ringing for back up. Vera didn't get back in the car with me, Ryan and Ian; she went over to Emma Dryburgh's house. Emma is Ryan's cousin and lives opposite Neil. When we got back home we realised that Vera had the keys so we couldn't get in; we waited in the street for Emma and Vera to come. When they did me, Emma and Vera went back up to Ballyhackamore in Emma's car to collect Toni and bring her down. Emma drives some sort of people cmrier. On the way back Toni said to drive down the Newtownards Road to see ifwe could see anyone. We turned left into Templemore Avenue and that's when I saw the men. I actually remember seeing a group of people on the left hand side of the road stood outside some sort of hall and they were all looking across the road. I looked across in the same direction as them and saw approximately 5 to 7 males running. By this time Emma had pulled into a street on the left opposite Langtry Court; I think it's Lime something. I was in the front passenger seat, Vera was behind me and Toni was behind Emma. We were parked facing onto Templemore Avenue and I had a clear view both left and right; the area is well lit and the weather was good. When I saw these men they were about halfway between Keen's furniture shop and the comer of Langtry Court, they were bolting, proper running. Some were faster than others but it was obvious they were together. I only observed these males for a matter of seconds and can't give any description of them or their clothing other than one of them was wearing a hat with a red porn porn and he appeared to be pulling his top up to cover his face. They ran into Langtry Comi towards a black Seat Ibiza vehicle, I didn't see any of the registration number. The vehicle was facing inwards and I saw a couple of these men get into it but Toni was going mental in the back and I was turned round to try and calm her down as she wanted to get out. So I didn't see where all the men went. The vehicle drove out of

Page 4 of 4 Langtry Court an turned left and drove in the direction of the Newtownards Road. Emma was going to follow them but someone in the car got a phone call to say that they had got Ian at the top of the street. We drove round into Cluan Place I saw Ryan holding his daddy who was on the ground. The Pastor and "Google" were there too. People were coming out trying to help by bringing towels and stuff; they were neighbours, one was called Greta. Ryan's cousin Tammy's fiance came over and took his shirt offand put it over Ian; there was also a dressing gown over him. Emma came with towels and I got one under his head. I really think Ian had gone by then, I didn't see any signs of life. Ian was lying on his left side, I could see a puncture wound on his upper right ann and another on his right side in the area of his ribs. His head was also really swollen. There was a big gash on his back which looked like it had been done with a knife. The Pastor was on the phone to the ambulance when we got there and Mark Dryburgh had rung the police. Eventually the ambulance anived and they told everyone to stand back and they put him in the ambulance. I saw that they were really working on him. The police arrived and started to put up �the tape, we went to the wee church and gave the police our details. I would not be able to recognise any of these men again.

I am the daughter ofian Ogle and Vera Johnston and I have one brother Ryan 
" 
; 
Johnston. I do not live at the family home. I reside at another address with my partner. On Sunday 27th January 2019, My partner Gareth Walker and I had invited my mum and dad along with Ryan and his girlfriend Lisa McAreavey to our home for Sunday dinner. They all arrived around 3 pm and Lisa drove my mum, dad and Ryan in her silver Ford Fiesta. Dinner was later than it was supposed to be and we didn't start eating at about 7-8 pm. We had a lovely evening. My Dad had a few beers and a couple of Irish coffees. Everyone was in good form, no one was drunk. The only persons who had alcohol was my Daddy and Gareth. Gareth's son Troy Walker, who is 11 years was also at our house. I cannot remember what time my mummy, daddy, Ryan and Lisa left my home but I think it was after 8 pm and maybe 9 pm. When they left, I washed dishes and generally tidied up downstairs. Within a short space of time after my family left, I lifted my mobile, which was on silent and noticed I had a 
number of missed calls from my cousin Emma Dryburgh. I knew something was wrong and it was only a short time since my mum and dad had left my house. I phoned Emma. Emma said have you heard what has happened. I said no and I 

Page 2 of 4 panicked, as there has been a long ongoing feud between my family and Neil Ogle. Emma told me that Ryan and my cousin, Neil Ogle, had got into an altercation on the Beersbridge Road. It shocked me because of the short space of time from which my family had left my home. But I was not shocked that the altercation was with Neil Ogle, as he has been one of the ones involved in tormenting my family. I asked Emma to come and get me as I was worried as to what was to come next. About I0-15 minutes later, Emma, my mummy and Lisa McAreavey arrived in Emma's car I asked what had happened, my mum and Lisa said, Neil Ogle and Ryan, my brother, were in a fist fight. I do know that Ryan had a lot of anger for Neil as Neil was passing information on to the UVF as to where Lisa lived in West Belfast, in order to get Ryan, set up to get attacked. This really upset Lisa and in tum Ryan was very angry towards Neil. I was shocked at the tum ofevents after a lovely family dinner. When we were in Emma's car, we immediately believed that the UVF were going to come for us because of the altercation between Neill and Ryan. The UVF have been trying to get Ryan and my Daddy for some time and this was a reason for them to attack my Daddy and Ryan that night. We drove out from my street out on to the Upper Newtownards Road. We drove down the Newtownards Road to Wyse Buys and we turned up a street near there although I can't remember which one. Emma suggested about driving by the.Newtownards Road, to see if anyone was about wearing dark clothing that may have been going to attack my Dad and Ryan. We were driving along the Newtowards Road, and along Belvoir Street which takes you out on to Templemore Ave and is then directly facing Langtree Court. It was at this point I was in the back seat, directly behind Emma and I observed a small group of men, possibly 4 running away from the direction ofKeen's furniture shop, down Templemore Avenue. One of the males ran ahead and went on down Templemore A venue, and into Madrid Street, All I could see was dark clothing and the street was dark. I couldn't say anything else about this male. Hejust ran in to Madrid Street. I noticed another possibly 3 males running and jumping into a car, that looked dark in colour, and was parked on the right hand side of the street as I was looking at it. I can't remember anything about the car. I had no idea how many doors the car had. I was immediately suspicious that these moves had been at my mummy's house and they had wrecked it. I started booting the inside of the car door to get out, but the child lock was on. I

Page 3 of 4 rolled down the window and screamed. I shouted 'we are going to get yous'. Whilst this was going on my mum, who was in the front of the car received a call on her mobile from Andrew Gunning. I heard my mum say "they've got Ian" I then could not see what or where the car I observed the males getting into went. I was focusing on what my mum was saying. I told Emma to hurry up and get to Cluan Place. Emma drove up Templemore Avenue and turned right at Keen's furniture, and turned right in to Cluan Place. We all ran out ofEmma's car and noticed my daddy lying on the ground and Ryan was holding him. Ryan was shouting "they sliced him". My daddy was on the road and edge of pavement, just at the railings at the entrance to Cluan Place. I noticed Pastor Kevin, and Andrew Gunning with my Dad. Kevin was on the phone. A lot of people then started to come out afterwards that included Greta Abbott, Eleanor Ferguson and May. I don't know her surname. They were trying to calm me down. I was kicking and screaming, and phoning family. I got through to my Aunt Lisa Duffield, she asked me if Ryan was fighting with Neil tonight". I was really shocked as to why she asked me that, as it had all happened so quickly. I said "yea" but I'd talk to her later. I couldn't figure out why Lisa asked this and how she knew what had happened. I got very angry at one point, as I noticed a female, known to me as Margaret Hutton, who I believe is in the UVF, drive past where my Daddy was dying. This female drove towards Short Strand, and she looked towards us and what was happening. I know Margaret Hutton as she was involved with my Daddy and Ryan and she told my Daddy, that he had to go for a punishment beating in 2017. I just thought it was strange that she drove past. I can't remember anything about her car, other that it was big and either silver/charcoal in colour. The church then opened their doors for us and we were in and out of the church, my Daddy was in the ambulance. My Daddy was taken to the R.V.H., my mum was with him. Gary and Kelly from the church, took me to the R.V.H. It was at the hospital I was told my Daddy had died. I am totally traumatised about what has happened. I believe that the people who did this were coming for my brother as a result of the altercation with Neil Ogle and the ongoing feud since I July 2017. I believe my Daddy knew they were coming and that's why he was at the top of the street to ensure they didn't come into the house. I did not recognise any of the persons I had observed .in Langtree Court. I only seen the dark clothing that they were wearing and some sort of woolly, 

Page 4 of 4 winter beanie type hat that one of them was wearing I could see that the woolly hat was turned up around the head. That is all I can recall as everything is such a blur. I cannot say if the male who had the beanie hat on ran ahead in to Madrid Street or got in to the parked car. I can say that from my observations none of the males had their faces covered.

This is a further statement in addition to the one I made to Detective Constable 
Younger on 11th Feb 2019. I wish to document how myself and my family have been intimidated by certain members ofthe UVF and known drug dealers specifically from 1st July 2017 until the present day and has ultimately resulted in my daddy's murder. On 1 st July 2017 1 was out with some friends, initially at my friend's house and then onto the Raven Social Club, Castlereagh Street. I had been in contact with my brother Ryan Johnston throughout the evening by phone with the intention ofmeeting up with 
him at some stage which we would normally do. Ryan was supposed to meet me at 
the Raven Social Club and I was expecting him to tum up which he didn't. I called 
him again and he told me that he was in the Albert on the Albertbridge Road as he had 
popped in to see my Aunt Lisa Duffield who was bar staffthere. Some time after 
midnight Ryan still hadn't showed so I rang him but there was no answer. He rang me 
back and said "Do you know Johnny Brown and "Saucy" they've just jumped me". I 
know that Saucy is Glen Rainey. I immediately hung up and literally ran all the way 
to the Albert Bar on my own. When I got to the Albert Bar. The doors were shut but 
the lights were still on so I banged and kicked the door. Johnny Brown and Glen

Paget2 of4 Rainey suddenly appeared to open the door. At this time it was my belief that Ryan was inside possibly being assaulted. So I tried to get past them but was thrown back. Johnny Brown kept slapping me and pushing me and I did end up on the ground a few times as did the handbag I was carrying and its contents. At one stage when Johnny Brown threw me backwards I managed to grab a hold of hist-shirt which ripped. Although Glen Rainey never actually touched me or physically assault me he did laugh and I heard him say, "You're in for it now!" I managed to push past Johnny Brown and Glen Rainey and make my way into the bar. There were loads of people in the bar and all of a sudden I could see and hear bottles being thrown. I immediately felt like I was under attack. Everything that happened next is pretty much a blur but I do remember Greg Edgar punching me repeatedly as I tried to protect my head and face with my arms. I also remember a guy called Ryan Davison (approx. in his 30s) starting to punch me. He was like something possessed and was clearly on drugs. I could sense that there was someone trying to pull me back to protect me but at that time I didn't know who it was. I also seen a female whom I know to be Paula Jackson (approx. in her 30s) throwing bottles towards my brother Ryan, my daddy Ian Ogle, and my uncle Colin. I ran at Paula and started to push and shove her to get her to stop. Both ofus were fighting with each other. Then Maggie Duffield (approx. in her 30s) managed to start breaking up the fighting and started ushering people out of the bar via the rear door which leads out to the rear alley way. I was stood crying and basically overwhelmed by what had just occurred when I noticed Alan Bo Irvine (approx. 37 years) chatting with Paula Jackson and she was pointing over to me. I suspected Alan and Paula were partners. Alan Bo Irvine made his way over to me and started shouting "She's got a fucking head injury". He then ran at me with a glass bottle raised in his hand as ifto strike it on me. I ran backwards to get out of the way. I seen my Uncle Colin offer Saucy and Johnny Brown a fair fight and from this I take it he meant without all these bottles and now bricks that were being thrown. My brother Ryan and my daddy were with Uncle Colin All of a sudden someone shouted that the Police were coming so everyone star burst. Me, my mummy, Aunt Lisa, Maggie Duffield, Uncle Colin, my brother Ryan and a few others made our way to my Aunt Lisa's house. I could then see that Ryan was badly assaulted with injuries to his face and a slice at the back of his head. Ryan's girlfriend Lisa McAreavey arrived in a

The following day, 2nd July 2017, I mostly slept but my boyfriend Gareth Walker and I decided to go for a bite to eat at the Welders. As we were sat down having a drink, Ryan Davison came in. It was early afternoon time. I shouted out to him "Are you gonna hit me now the way you did last night". He immediately denied hitting me and said, "It was my mate Greg Edgar". Since this has happened I have experienced various incidences of intimidation as has other family members and friends including a sense of being followed, certain members of the UVF appearing in places that I am, and intimidating looks and stares. My daddy was to have both arms broken and pay �500 in damages to the Albert Bar. Ryan was to receive another beating and both assaults were to occur on Friday 2t1st July 2017. My father never agreed despite two further punishment appointments. As far as I am aware nobody has ever refused to go to their punishment appointment. It is unheard of within the community and we feared that there would be severe consequences. My daddy tried to prepare Ryan and I for the worst. My daddy had explained that they would either kill him or leave him like a vegetable. My daddy kept saying that they will try and get Ryan and I know he hoped that they would get him instead. Our family were victims to a sustained campaign ofintimidation in the following months up until my daddy's murder and even now. One sunny Saturday afternoon some time end August/September I was outside Iceland on the Newtownards Road with my mum and my cousin Jodie Lee Currie. When my mum went into the shop Alan Bo Irvine saw me and started to verbally abuse me saying things like, "at least I can walk the road", "Yous don't have a clue what's coming" "I'm going to leave your brother for dead", what happened your brother in the bar, this will be 1t0 times worse". Some males who were outside the Great Eastern Bar took Alan Bo Irvine offside. This incident was not reported to Police as I was too afraid. Some time Sept/Oct 2017 at approximately 7 am 4 masked men went to my daddy's work in Newtownards armed with hurley sticks and baseball bats. My father thankfully was already inside, clocked in and all however my daddy's friend Roy Thompson who had arrived at the same time as the 4 masked men had his car wrecked as he sat inside it. This incident was reported by Roy Thompson but I also reported it to Police as there were cars going past my front window, a lot more than normal. I felt in danger. My daddy was murdered on 27th Jan

I am the partner of Ian Ogle. We have been together as a couple for 30 years. We have two children together, Toni who is 27 years and Ryan who is 23 years, We have lived as a family at our current address for 14 years. Ian had been previously employed as a window fitter up until around September 2017, when Ian was threatened and a colleague's car who was attacked as his work place, "Superior Windows" in Newtownards or Comber. On this particular day of the incident, Ian was along with Roy Thompson. Roy was sitting in his car and Ian had gone in to his workplace to swipe in. Roy remained outside. Four masked men attacked Roy's car with hurley bats causing substantial damage. This man Roy, was told not to have anything to do with Ian and to stay away from him, and Roy did stay away from Ian and our family, My belief of this incident was, that it was linked to an ongoing campaign of threats and intimidation against Ian and our family, since the incident in the Albert Bar on 1 st July 2017, when our son Ryan was assaulted by Glen Rainey and Johnny Brown. Ryan phoned me that night and said he had been "jumped" and "attacked" by both Glen Rainey and Johnny Brown, because he gave Glen Rainey a dirty look. I woke Ian up and told him what was happening. I was trying also to phone Toni but couldn't

Page 2 of 5 get her, I eventually phoned Gareth who is Toni's partner and Gareth told me that Ryan had already phoned Toni and she was on her way to Ryan. I then eventually made my way to the Albert Bar. When I got there, the door of the Bar was open. I noticed bottles broken and stools overturned. I was looking for Toni. I found Toni, who was with Lisa Duffield and she was distressed. I could see Ryan had a black eye and an injury to his head. There was lot of arguing going on. When we were leaving the bar we met up again with Glen Rainey, Alan Irvine, Johnny Brown and I can't recall who else were there. But there was a bit of slabbering and shouting. One of the men went to attack Ian with a brick. We then just went to Lisa Duffield's house. Since this incident there has been threats and intimidation against my family. We were told by a source, I do not want to identify, they told us that Ian had to get his arms broken and pay �500 damages to the Albert Bar, Ryan was get a "dig in the gub" and that was all. I was raging and upset. Ian and Ryan were to attend on a Friday night for the beating and we all just said no, and didn't go. I can't remember where the location, was that Ryan and Ian were to attend. I don't think it had been confirmed. Ian and Ryan never did attend. We have however lived in fear since this incident. Ian's mummy paid �500 to the organization for the damage to the bar. Ian had actually went to the Albert Bar and spoke with the owner, John Brannigan, and explained he would not disrespect his Bar. We had hoped that when the �500 was paid that things would get back to normal, but they never really did. There has being an ongoing campaign of threats and violence against my family and I since then. On one occasion, I don't remember the date, but it was the first anniversary of East Belfast Taxis opening. Toni and I, along with my sister Belle and her daughters Tammy, Jodie-Lee, were outside Iceland on the Newtownards Rd, when Alan Irvine came along with his girlfriend Paula Jackson. When I was in the shop, Tammy came in and told me to come out, when I went outside, Alan Irvine and Toni were arguing. I heard him say "I'm going to leave your son for dead". Irvine said "Your Da will never walk the Newtownards Road again" referring to Ian. At that point a number of fellas from the Dee-Side Bar came over and broken the argument up. Since July 2017 Ian lived in fear of these people coming to attack our family and our home. I meant to say that on the night of 1 July 2017 Neil Ogle who is a cousin of Ian was present in the Bar when the row happened. He did not intervene to help Ryan that night. I believe that Neil

Page 3 of 5 failed to get involved as he is affiliated with the UVF with drugs. He could have stopped the row that night. Ryan was very fond of Neil and was really hurt that Neil did not help him. In fact he said he didn't see anything on the night of the row. On Sunday 27th January 2019, Ian, me and Ryan along with Ryan's girlfriend Lisa McAreavey went to Toni's house for Sunday dinner. We all went in Lisa's car to Toni's house. All I know it is a small silver car. The car has only two doors, one side door does not work. I think it was just before 9 pm when we left Toni's house. We had a quiet, uneventful ay at Toni's. When we left Lisa drove the car, Ryan was in the front beside Lisa. I was in the back, behind Ryan and Ian was behind Lisa. We drove down Holland Drive, in to Kirkiston to the roundabout at Bloomfield, we travelled along the Beersbridge Road towards home. I heard Ryan saying "Mummy, there's Neil" referring to Neil Ogle. This was near Eddie Spence's Chip Shop. Lisa stopped the car. I was looking about and I wasn't sure ifit was Neil or not. Ryan got out of the car and ran over to Neil. I heard Ryan shouting, "You could have stopped this" Ian and I were trying to get out of the car, but the seat was stuck. Ian was shouting "Let me out". Lisa let us out. When I looked out the window I could see Neil and Ryan digging the head off each other. Ian was out of the car before me. I ran over as the fight was moving down the road a bit away from the chip shop. I could see people stopping their cars and I was explaining that they didn't know what "they" had done to my son. One lady actually hugged me. These people were strangers to me. I ran over to where Ryan and Neil were. Ryan was hitting Neil and Ian was shouting "go on son". Ian was shouting for Neil to go and get the rest of them. I could see Ian talking to a man, who had stopped at the scene and Ian was explaining to him what they had done to his son referring to all of the previous incidents. Ian was shouting to Neil to get "Saucey" who is Glen Rainey and Sewell, who is Mark Sewell. I pulled Ian away and I was able to pull Ryan away too. I told them to get into the car. I ran over to my niece's house, Emma Dryburgh. She lives at I told Emma what had happened. When I came out Ryan, Ian and Lisa were all back in Lisa's car and I told them to go on. I went into Emma's house and we were all trying to phone Toni. I explained to Toni what had happened and she asked that Emma come up and get her. Emma and I got in to her car, then I got a call from someone that Ryan, Ian and Lisa couldn't get in to our house as I had the keys. Emma and I drove to my house and I

Pagee4 of5 gave Ian and Ryan my keys. Lisa McAreavey jumped into Emma's car with us. We then drove directly to Toni's house and picked her up. Lisa was in the front passenger seat and I was in the back behind Lisa and Toni sat behind Emma. We drove down the Newtownards Road direction. We turned up Templemore Ave, from the Newtownards Road. I noticed two males running down Templemore Ave, from the Albert Bridge Rd end, on the Langtry Court side. I think the males had part of their faces covered. I said to the others to look, Toni started to get agitated and attempted to get out of the car, but couldn't because the child locks were on I noticed a car sitting in Langtry Court, the car had lights on. I thought it was strange and things just weren't right. I didn't see anyone getting in to the car. I was more interested in keeping Toni calm. I then got a phone call from Andrew Gunning to my mobil. Andrew said you may get round here, they've got Ian. I told the others in the car and we drove directly to Cluan Place. When we arrived I could see Ian lying on the ground at the entrance to Cluan Place. I could see Pastor Kevin with Ian also Ryan was with Ian. Andrew was standing on the other side of the road with his dog. The ambulance had not arrived. Andrew said Ian had been hit with a flick bat across across the face. Ryan was saying, Ian had been sliced. I didn't go over to where Ian was. I was petrified and I was hoping Ian would be OK. I tried phoning Ian's mummy and his brothers. Then people from the street, started coming out. I can't recall who I seen, as I was so upset. Toni was distraught and was shouting. The ambulance arrived. I noticed the ambulance man getting out of the ambulance and then getting back in because Andrew Gunning had his dog with him. Andrew then had to move the dog. The ambulance staff went over to Ian I don't know what they were saying as I wasn't close enough. Eventually the police arrived and I was shouting at them. They worked for ages with Ian at the scene. I was then in the ambulance with Ian and we went to the Royal Victoria Hospital. At that point I didn't think it was very serious. When we arrived at the hospital I was taken to the family room were I remained until the hospital staff told me that Ian had died. They told me Ian's heart had stopped and they were unable to get it going. I am complete! y traumatised and numb about what has happened to Ian. My children have been left without their father and me without my life long partner. I believe that Ian has been murdered as a result of the incident in the Albert Bar in July 2017. The UVF had said Ian was making a mockery of the UVF by

I am the son oflan Ogle. On Sunday 27th January 2019 I went to my sister Toni Johnston's house in Ballyhackamore to watch the Rangers match. It was about 4 o'clock, and I went in my girlfriend Lisa McAreavey's car, along with my Dad Ian Ogle and my mum Vera Johnston. We stayed in Toni's house until about 9 pm and then we all left to go home back to Cluan Place. I hadn't taken any drink or drugs and my dad had about 4 beers in Toni's. We drove home taking the road from the Orangefield roundabout and down onto the Beersbridge Road. I was in the front passenger seat, Lisa was driving and my mum and dad were in the back. It was dark by now but any. As we were driving along the Beersbridge Road I saw my cousin Neil Ogle. He was just walking past the 'key shop', he was texting on his phone. He was wearing a bobble hat, think it was navy blue, navy blue jacket and trousers on and grey trainers. He was on his own. I didn't notice anyone else about. I asked Lisa to pull over because I wanted to fight with him. A year ago I had been in the Albert Bar when I'd gotten into a fight with Glen Rainey and Jonny Brown and he was there and didn't help me or try to protect me. There has been bad blood since then and I never forgave him. When I saw him on Sunday I wanted to fight with him because ofthis. I

Page 2 of3 got out ofthe car and ran towards him, I would have run from a few metres away. I grabbed him and I started punching him about the face and body. I headbutted him too. He punched me back a couple of times. My dad had gotten out ofthe car and came over too and I don't remember him punching Neil but he did grab him and said, "You hurt my family" and said to me "Get into him son". Then he left me to it really. The whole fight lasted about a few minutes, and then he ran off towards his girlfriend's house. His girlfriend's was up the road but I could see him, I didn't know this was his girlfriend's house at the time. A girl came to the window and looked out and he pointed at his eye which was bleeding a lot and then the girl came out and then I saw Neil on his phone and heard him say, "Right mate" to someone. I had a few injuries, I had a black eye and some bruises round my head, Neil was bleeding from his eye, but I didn't see any other injuries. Neither ofus ended up on the ground at any stage. I then tried to call at my mate's house, Andrew Gunning, who lives close by. But he wasn't there, so I get back in Lisa's car and went home. My Dad came home too in the car but my mum went to see Emma Drysburgh who lives round from the Bus Stop on the Beersbridge Road. We got home to Cluan Place, we had to wait a while because my mum had the house keys. She eventually arrived and let us in, and I said to my dad I was going up to get a shower. I wasn't bleeding but I was shook up and my eye was swollen. I was in the shower for a few minutes and got out to get dried when my friend Andrew Gunning came to the door and was shouting "They've got your daddy, they've got your daddy!e" I wasn't even aware that Daddy had left the house. I put my shorts and a jumper on and my trainers and ran up to the entrance to the street and saw my daddy lying face down on the side of the road, the Pastor was there. I knelt down and turned him over, shouting "Daddy, daddy!" He didn't say anything, he was making a sound, the nurse said it would be like a last breath. I pulled his T-shirt up, and straight away I saw he had slice marks to his back and shoulder. I was just holding his head and had him in my arms. Daddy was unconscious. I can't remember clearly what happened after this but I recall Emma pulling up with my mummy and Lisa and Toni in the car. I had been in the shower when they had gone to get Toni after what had happened with my fight with Neil. That's when Toni took the video on her Instagram. She didn't realise Daddy was dying, they thought he was just unconscious at the time. I knew it was more serious. Everyone was out on the street at 


Page 3 of3 this time. my cousin's boyfriend, Andrew Forsythe took his shirt off and put it under my Daddy's head and I ran back to the house to get towels. I didn't see anyone running away from the scene or anywhere around when I arrived at first. It felt like ages before the ambulance came. The police arrived shortly after the ambulance. They took my Daddy into the ambulance and I helped them with the stretcher. I then walked to the church with Kevin the Pastor. The church started offering people tea and water. I believe that ifl hadn't gotten out of the car to Neil then that wouldn't have happened to my Daddy. This has all started over someone getting a dirty look in a bar a year ago. But I believe my Daddy was attacked because ofmy fight with Neil earlier in the night and that had they not got my Daddy in the street they would've came to my house for me and my Daddy.

This all began on 1st July 2017. I had been at home with my friend Andrew Gunning and we had been waiting on the parade. It was the 1st July Somme celebrations. We decided to go to the 'Con Club' but when we got there it was empty so we went to the Albert Bar where my Auntie Lisa works behind the bar. There was me, Andrew, Andrew's girlfriend Chelsea Bradley and we would have got to the Albert at about I 0:30 pm. It was a good start to the night, my cousin Neil Ogle was there and we were there chatting. He introduced me to "Bo" (Alan Irvine), telling him I was Ian's son. We even had a group photo taken ofus. I was there about 2 hours when Glen Rainey and Jonny Brown came in. I could feel the tension as soon as they came in. I would never usually go to the Albert. I only went down to see my Auntie. At about 1 am the DJ was finishing up and Glen Rainey was starting to collect money for a lock in. He was going around collecting the money and I tapped him on the shoulder to tell him that the DJ wanted out. He turned round and says to me "stop fucking tapping me". I was shocked. I've never had any beef with Glen Rainey before (his nickname is Saucy) so I don't know why he was rude to me. He has a reputation for always getting into rows. He'd fight with his shadow. Anyway, I just walked off and went and sat

Page 2 of 4 back down with my friends. Andrew Gunning said to me "The cheek of him". I saw Glen giving Lisa the money for the lock in and then he came towards me saying "You're the one firing dirty looks". I stood up because I knew by the way he was getting on he was going to hit me. I didn't get a chance though because Jonny Brown just punched me to the left side of my face. He kept on punching me with both fists. He was actually holding on to the chair I was sitting on and stamping on me too. Glen didn't really get near me because Jonny was doing all the punching. At one point I Saw Neil my cousin look over to see who they were punching but he didn't intervene, it went on for about 15 minutes. My Auntie Lisa came over too and tried to stop it. At one point I heard Ryan Davidson say he was going to kill me. Chris Haire was there and he bear hugged me trying to protect me. Eventually Lisa managed to get me out the back of the bar away from it all. My uncle Colin was there and he'd been in the toilet the whole time. He came out and found me all beaten up out the back. He asked me what had happened. My left eye was all swollen up and my nose was bleeding. I rang my sister Toni and told her what had happened, she was in the Raven Social Club at the time. I then rang my mummy. They both said they were on their way. I made my way down the side of the bar and back round to the front of the bar again and by the time I got there Toni was already there banging on the door trying to get in. She was on her own. Then mummy and daddy arrived. Daddy saw my face and went mad. Toni managed to get in the door closed behind her, I kicked it once and we got in. It would have been about 3 am at this point. There would have been me, mummy, daddy, Toni, my uncle Colin and Andrew Gunning. I could see in front ofus Glen Rainey, Jonny Brown, Greg Edgar, Ryan Davidson, Bo (Alan Irvine), and Bo's girlfriend Paula Jackson. Then all hell broke loose. They started throwing everything at us. Stools, tables, bottles. Daddy said "You bate my son!" I can't remember who did what but they were just lifting everything and throwing it at us. Bo grabbed me at one point and started fighting with me. They were all holding bottles. Glen tried to bottle my Daddy but he missed. Daddy was bottled but don't know who did it. I was bottled. Toni was beaten up too. My mummy was trying to lift stools and tables out of the way. Everyone else was just standing around shocked and watching. There was about 30 people watching. It went on for a good while. I never remembered how I got out of there but we somehow did. They came out too and there were some running battles in

Page 3 of4 the street. At one point I saw Glen Rainey doing pull ups in the street, he was so off his face. Eventually the police came and we all walked back to Lisa's. I had a black, swollen eye and nose, bruising. It was mostly on my left side. We were told that Daddy was to have his 2 arms broke, I had to be beaten up and we had to pay �500 for the damage to the bar. I don't know who was supposed to do this, but we were to go to a bar on the Friday night to be taken somewhere to have this done to us. They told us not to tell anyone. My granny ended up paying �500 to them in the hope that that would reduce the tension but it didn't. They came back and told us that I was going to be left alone but that Daddy still had to be punished. He just refused to go down. We both refused. The leadership just wanted to get my Dad. Eventually in September 2017 they turned up at his work in N ewtownards and they put the windows in on his friend's car asking where he was. Dad had to leave his job then. He didn't want to bring that trouble to their door. There were about 3 or 4 messages for my dad to come for his punishment but he wouldn't go. Also around September, Bo threatened my mum and Toni, saying "At least I can walk the road, Ryan's dead". After this there were a few instances of intimidation. Greg Edgar drove past in a car one day outside Russells Shop on the Albertbridge Road, he waved over at me and my Daddy. I went over to the car and told him to come and beat me like they beat my sister". But he didn't. I also met Jonny Brown in Russells one day and he put his shopping down when he saw me. I told him to beat me like he beat my sister. He then rang someone and the next thing Rhys Kirkwood came up. I think this was for back up if there was a fight. My Dad was with me. There was no fight in the end. Just slabbering. I heard that he went straight to Sewell after that. Sewell is the 2nd in Command in East Belfast. I think they realized that Russells was where we shopped so there were a few more incidents there with Greg. There was another time at Avoniel School where Bo had Rhys Kirkwood there with a balaclava on ready to jump my cousin's husband Mark Dryburgh. I think this was to draw me and Daddy out. That was January 2018 I have had a few altercations with Neil Ogle also. We fought on the day Daddy was killed. This all came from the incident in the Albert Bar. He didn't stand up for us. In July 2018 me and Andrew Gunning were waiting on parades. On the 12th on the road I saw Bo speaking to Stephen Matthews who is UVF Brigadier on the road. Next thing Makkers (Stephen Matthews) came over and told us to get off the road or we 


Page 4 of 4 were getting our heads jabbed off us. I've seen Glen Rainey and we've had words in town and he was Facebook messaging me giving me grief too. Really since the incident in the Albert the intimidation has rumbled on ending with my Daddy being murdered in the street.

I am the niece of Vera Johnston, and Vera is the partner of Ian Ogle, my mother and Vera are sisters. I would have a close relationship with Ian and Vera and I would see them daily as I only live 5 minutes walk away. Vera and Ian have two children, Toni and Ryan Johnston. On Sunday 27th January 2019 between 7.30 -8.00 pm I was at home with my husband Marc and our three children. My grandfather, Thomas Johnston was also present and that evening we were all sitting in the house when I heard a bang at my front window, I went to the front door and saw my aunt Vera there, she looked panicked. She said "did you not see that", I hadn't seen anything and didn't know what she was talking about. Vera then explained that her son Ryan and their cousin Neil Ogle had been fighting. Neil Ogle is the son of Billy Ogle, and Billy Ogle is the brother of Harry Ogle who is Ian's father, making Ian and Neil first cousins. Lisa McAreavey is the girlfriend of Ryan Johnston, her car was pulled up outside my house. Her cfflt-fflfflffl; ffl was parked on Calvin Street facing my house. Inside it was Ian and Ryan Ogle with Lisa driving. Ian 
was in the front passenger seat and Ryan was sitting in the rear passenger seat I

Pageh2of5 noticed that Ryan had a fresh cut on the bridge of his nose and both Ryan and Ian appeared shook up. The only thing that was said when I went over to the car was that Ian wanted to go home ----. Vera stayed with me and both of us returned to my house when Vera received a phone call but I'm not sure who this was from. Vera had the front door key to their home so we had to bring the key to them. I agreed to drive Vera there, but I then phoned Toni and asked did she have a key to 4 Cluan Place, I then handed my mobile phone to Vera and Vera and Toni continued with a conversation which I never heard and I had left the room. I drove Vera back home and handed the front door key to either Ryan or Ian. Lisa then jumped into my car and Vera, Lisa and me went and collected Toni from her home address. Whilst in the car Vera then told us what had happened between Ryan and Neil and that Vera was driving along the Beersbridge Road and Ryan saw Neil Ogle at Eddie Spence fish shop. Neil told his mum to stop as he needed to get out of the car, Vera stopped and Ryan got, he approached Neil Ogle and they began to scuffle with each other. Ian Ogle also got out of the car and Neil went for Ian. Neil then left. I then drove along the Albertbridge Road, NewtownardsRoad towards the Templemore A venue medical centre, when I was approaching there I saw 5 males running and I knew something was wrong so I slowed right down as I wanted to get a better look. They were coming from the direction ofup Templemore Avenue towards Newtownards Road. They were at the junction of Langtry Court at this time, Langrtry Court was on my right hand side. Their faces were partially covered with scarves and were wearing beanie hats. I then pull into Harvey Court and completed a 3 point tum which is opposite and up a little from Langtry Court. From there I saw a small dark coloured hatchback car, partial number JCZ parked facing out of Langtry Court, I noticed that the interior light was on inside this car and the driver's door was open but there was nobody sitting in the driver's seat at this time. I saw a man sitting in the front passenger seat he was wearing what appeared to be dark coloured clothing, his head was covered and he was wearing a scarf over his face. I then observed a male who was stocky build, approximately 5'8h" in height with wide shoulders and he appeared to have a beer belly. This male was dressed in dark coloured clothing and was wearing a green/black/red Glentoran scarf which he was pulling up over his face. He was wearing a hoodie type jacket which was not a heavy coat, a dark coloured

Page 3 of 5 beanie hat and gloves. He was standing at the corner of Langtry Court and he was waving at 2 other males who appeared to run pass Langtry Court junction. These 2 males which run pass the junction were both wearing dark coloured clothing and were ofslim build. I cannot provide any other description. The last male I can describe as being of similar build as the previous 2, he was approximately 5'6" -5'8" tall and wearing dark coloured clothing, he was wearing a beanie hat with his hood pulled up over the hat. He was wearing Adidas tracksuit bottoms with stripes running along the upper part ofthe thigh and finishing at his knees. The 2 males which ran passed the junction then came back and all 5 males were in the car. The car then left Langtry Court turned right down Major Street. When I saw all this I was sitting stationary approximately halfa road width away, the street was well lit and there was no obstructions in my view. I didn't hear any ofthem speak as my windows were up in my car. The reason why I am saying that they were 5 males was because ofthe gait and clothes they were wearing looked more like that ofa man. At this point Toni tried to ring Ryan but it went to answer machine, but then either Lisa or Toni got a telephone call from someone to say that Ian had been sliced. I then drove straight to Cluan Place and I saw a male on the ground at the top ofCluan Place, he was lying beside a drain and I saw that it was Ian Ogle. I also saw a man with Ian, I do not know his name but I know that he is a member ofthe nearby church. Ian was lying in the recovery type position and was naked from the waist up, I could see that his top had been partially removed and attached to one arm. I noted that there were stab wounds to Ian's back and I could see his blood running into the drain and at that point thought that Ian was dead. Me, Toni,Lisa and Vera were out ofthe car, I took offmy house coat and put it on Ian's back to add pressure to the wounds. I then ran to Greta Abbott's house in Cluan Place where I got towels, but enroute I telephoned my husband Marc and told him that Ian had been stabbed. When I ran back to Ian, a crowd had gathered and I cannot recall who was there as this is a blur, and emergency services had not arrived at this time, although I was speaking to the police on the telephone, who explained that Marc had rang them and were trying to keep me calm during this. Ian Ogle and his family including me have been subject ofintimidation and harassment since an occurred in the Prince Albert Bar on 1 st July 2017 where Ryan was assaulted inside the bar by 2 men. What I know ofthis is that Ryan was in

Page 4 of5 the bar drinking alone when Glen "Saucy" Rainey said to Ryan "who are you throwing a dirty look at" then Glen Rainey swung a punch and missed Ryan to which then Johnny "Browner" Brown then jumped on Ryan's head. Ryan was then taken to a back room and a phone call was made to Toni who then came down to the Prince Albert Bar and couldn't get in. Toni began to kick at the front door, breaking a panel, Johnny Brown then came out from the bar and hit Toni. Ian and Vera then made their way there and entered the bar where there were chairs and bottles thrown at him. Toni was hit a second time, in the bar by Greg Edgar. Ian, Ryan, Toni and Vera then left the bar onto the bottom of the Newtownards Road, and at the same time people were leaving the Prince Albert Bar from the back entrance where this assault continued and Ian got hit twice. Ian told this man, "try that again and I will retaliate", Ian was pulled back by a friend. Neil Ogle was in the bar that night when Ryan was assaulted and walked away and did not intervene. This caused much annoyance to Ryan and Ian. From the paramilitaries there was an appointment made for Ian to have both his arms broken as he should not have started in one of their bars and he should have waited and had a 24 hour cooling off period. Ian ignored this and kept that appointment and the harassment and intimidation has been happening ever since then. Other incidents have happened, for example a few months ago Greg Edgar had threatened to shoot Ryan dead. Before Christmas 2018 Greg Edgar attempted to run over Ian in his car. Ian and Ryan have been continually verbally abused with such things as "you're dead, I'll put you in my boot". On 11th January 2018 my husband Marc was collecting our child from Elmgrove Nursery unit when he walked passed Alan "Bo" Irvine, Marc overheard Alan speaking on the phone saying "yes he is coming past me now". Marc said to Bo "me?" Bo replied "are you fucking slabbering, I'll wait for you here" Marc rang me and I told him to stay in the school reception. I arrived at the school a short time later and I saw Reece Kirkwood, Johnny Brown and Bo waiting outside the school. I confronted them and Bo told me about an argument that our daughter and his step daughter had had. I think that this was a ploy to get uncle Ian out on the street, as we have had no grief with these people and we used to speak to them on previous occasions. I know of another occasion since July 2017 involving Ian Ogle. Ian used to work at Blair Neill PVC Windows in Newtownards, he would have occasionally travelled with Roy, I do not know Roy's surname but believe he lives in the Cregagh

One day whilst Ian was getting a lift with Roy they were followed to work by4 masked men, they had arrived at work and Ian went to clock on, whilst he was inside his work, these 4 men wrecked Roy's car. Ian got paid off after this and Roy stopped speaking/bothering with him. All of the above incidents mentioned were neverreported to police as they were afraid of the paramilitaries and of being branded astouts. I asked Ian on several times was he a member of the UVF but he never told meoutright whether he was an active member or not, but Ian does have friends and associates that are members of the UVF. Ian's opinion of the UVF was that he does notlike what the UVF is today. I am not aware of any other history that Ian Ogle or any member of his family have with the paramilitaries other than what I have mentioned. ED

----�--. On Sunday27th of January2019 I ----�--was ___ _ looking after a children's party. I left work at approximately 19:00 hours. I walked around to the Albert Bar to meet my mother Hetty Duffield. Mummy works there and had finished at 18:00 hours when I arrived mummy was sitting at the bar on the public side. The Albert Bar is only around thee-----, so it took me only a couple of minutes to get there. I am not sure how long we had been there when Neil Ogle came in. I do not speak to him following a family fall out but he is a cousin of Ian and Colin's. He came in and spoke to a couple ofpeople. He had a look around the bar, said hello to some people and left again after2-3 minutes. I don't remember how long, maybe an hour or so later the door burst open. I was still sitting at the bar and glanced around to see Mark Sewell come in and come straight up to me. I would know Mark Sewell to say hello to for approximately the last ten years. We live in a small area and I would see him about and the odd time in the con club and

Page 2 of2 the Albert Bar. He came right up to me and shouted "You're fucking getting put out of the country. You and your family". I think he also said something about 24 hours. I asked him what was going on? He said "Neil Ogle is lying in a pool ofblood and you got him set up" or words to that effect. He shouted at me to "get out of the bar now" and then he stormed back out the door. I stayed sitting at the bar and asked my mum Hetty to go out and see what it was all about. A couple of minutes later she came back into the bar and said that Mark Sewell had threatened her as well and told her she was getting put out of her house too. Mummy said he got into a black or dark coloured car which was driven by Johnny Brown. The car then drove off. I was very scared and wanted to get out of the pub. Me and mummy left and went around to the Con Club. We walked and didn't see anyone around. I think this would have been around 21:00 hours. We were in the Con Club for less than an hour when I got a call on my mobile telephone from Toni Johnstone who is Ian's daughter Toni was saying. "They've got my daddy, they've stabbed him, there's blood". After that call almost straight away I received another call from Vera, Ian's partner. She was saying "Lisa I think he's dead". I was in shock. I rang my partner Colin and told him Ian had been stabbed. I then asked Toni Hastings who works behind the bar to phone Vera's niece Emma, who she would be friendly with and find out what was going on. That may have been how I found out Ian was confirmed to be dead or someone else may have told me. I then phoned Colin again and told him Ian was dead. My mum phoned my sister Maggie Duffield who then collected us both. They drove me to the Royal Victoria Hospital and dropped me off. I then met up with Vera and the family.

Ian Ogle is my daughter's partner's brother. My daughter's partner is Colin Ogle. My 
daughter is Lisa Duffield. Lisa _______ _ 
-was working on Sunday.h-------.
--On Sunday 27th January 2019 I was working from I pm until 6 pm. Lisa 
finished her work and came round to the Albert Bar to meet me, sometime around 
7pm. I had finished work at 6 pm and was sitting at the bar counter on my own having 
a drink until Lisa came round. It had been a quiet day in the bar and there was only a 
few of the older regulars in the bar at this time. At around 9 pm the door of the bar 
flew open, it was really loud. I was sitting with my back to the door, Lisa was sitting 
sideways to the door. I turned round and saw Mark Sewell bounce in through the door 
I have known Mark Sewell for maybe 20 years as he used to be a doorman in the 
Albert Bar when we used to have discos. At first I didn't recognise him as I haven't 
seen him in maybe 3 years and he looked like he had put weight on but it may have 
been because he was mostly covered up. He was all in dark clothing, he was wearing 
a black puffy type jacket. I didn't notice what bottoms he was wearing but they were 
dark coloured as well. He was wearing a black beanie hat with some red on it, at the

Page 2 of3 front. He came straight over to Lisa and up into her face shouting. He said something like "It's all your fault, he's lying down there in a pool of blood" to Lisa. He didn't say who he was talking about and we didn't know who or what he was talking about. He said "You've 24 hours to get out, you and your fucking family". He was really really mad, really angry. This all happened in less than a minute and he turned on his heels and left the bar. Lisa told me to go out and see what it was all about. I went out of the bar after him. When I went out of the bar I seen Mark down to my left about to get into a biggish black car which was parked on the Albertbridge Road, facing in the direction of the Newtownards Road. I said "Mark, what's going on what's this all about?" At this point he had turned towards me and moved away from the car a bit, in my direction. He said "I've been a friend of yours for years but you're out too". When he was saying this I was standing, with my hand out, open, but he was pointing his finger at me. He was aggressive and shouting and I was scared. When Mark was shouting at me. I saw Jonny Brown at the drivers side of the black car. At some point he must have moved towards the back of the car, closer to me as I could see that he was wearing the same clothes as he had been wearing earlier that day. He was wearing light grey shorts, like sweatshirt material and a light grey hoodie with short sleeves. He then moved towards the front of the car and got into the drivers side front seat. He didn't say anything to myself or Mark. I think the car was 4 doors. I know Jonny Brown for about ten years just from coming in and out of the bar. He came in sometime earlier on Sunday afternoon, I'm not sure what time it was, but sometime between I pm and 6 pm. He wasn't in for very long, he spoke to two of the regulars, Noel Finlay and Kenny. I'm not sure ofKenny's surname. I was the only staff member working during the day. Owen Downey took over in the barlllt-.--. Owen is a young fella with ginger hair and he's very thin. After Mark shouted and pointed at me he went back to the black car that Jonny Brown had got into the driver's seat of, Mark got into the front passenger side. I didn't see the car move off as I went straight back into the bar to Lisa. I was still unaware of what this was all about. Lisa and I were afraid of Mark coming back again and I said we had to get out of the bar I got Owen to let us out the back of the Albert Bar that leads to a side street the Conn bar is on. The Conn bar is what we caU the Belfast Constitutional Club. We didn't go into the bar we sat on seats outside. Lisa was on the phone. Lisa

Page 3 of3 was crying and in an awful state. She told me that Neill Ogle had got a beating and that she thought that Mark Sewell had thought, that she had got him beat up. She thought that Mark Sewell believed, she had told people where Neill Ogle was. Neill Ogle is Colin and Ian Ogle's cousin. When we were sitting on the seats outside the Conn Bar Lisa told me that Neill Ogle had put his head in through the door of the Albert Bar when we had been there, between 7 pm and 9 pm. I didn't see Neill come in, or look in at any time. We went into the Conn Club about 9.20 pm. Lisa was on the phone but I dont know who with. Some time shortly after this she told me that Ian Ogle and Ryan Johnson Ian's son had went after Neill. Lisa was in an awful state, crying and she was in and out of the bar on her phone. Sometime before 10 pm Lisa told me Ian was dead. She said "Mummy, they've got, him, they've got him, he's dead". The girl behind the bar gave Lisa a drink to calm her nerves and then we called Maggie my other daughter to come and pick us up and take us to the hospital. We dropped Lisa off and we came back home, Maggie and I. When Mark Sewell had came into the Albert Bar there had been a few regulars in, but I can't remember who was there. Noel Finlay had definitely left before Mark came in as he had to go to work. I'm not sure if Kenny was there when Mark was in. Noel Finlay is 50 years old, small in height, thin with brown hair going grey. Kenny would be around late 40s stocky build and dark hair. I can't recall what either were wearing.

I am a Pastor at the Covenant Love Church situated at 156-164 Albertbridge Road, Belfast. On Sunday the 27th of January 2019 at approximately 9 pm I am not quite sure, it would have been around 10 minutes before I contacted 999 so whatever time you can ascertain that that was. I left one of our Congregation, Mary Philips around to her car as it was dark and I didn't want her to walk alone. Mary was parked in the car park behind our Church, the entrance to which is from Cluain Place which turning right out of our front door is the first turn on the right. Just as we entered Cluain Place I met Ian Ogle, his nickname is Ogie. I stopped, shook his hand and spoke to him. Mary just waved and went on to go to her car. We stood chatting at the mouth of the junction of Cluain Placewith the Albertbridge Road. We spoke for about a good I 0 minutes or so. He was in an agitated state, not out of control but, I know there had been some sort of altercation involving his son or daughter with a local group. With the UVF. Ian didn't mention them by name but I have always suspected that was the group he was having difficulties with, there has been a number of incidents going back to 2017. Someone in a car tried to run him over, a number of shouting matches on the streets. Ian was UVF himself but he considered himself Old School, he

Page 2 of 4 disagreed with drugs, he told me so before, he was very anti them. This may have been a cause of the fall out, this was the impression I got from him, that it may have led to he and his family falling out with them. I forget the precise words he used but he was standing out concerned because there had been an incident with either his son or daughter this evening about 10 minutes before we met. I think he was there trying to protect his family. He isn't someone who would go out to provoke people but he certainly wasn't in their, the UVF's good book, but he had no intention of standing down, I think he may have said "Their on their way". I got a sense of impending doom. We also spoke about God. Ian wasn't part of our congregation but I have known him for a number of years. They were very welcoming to their home. He considered himself a loyalist, he had a cause but disagreed with aspects of UVF criminality and he stood his ground on that. He told me he had a fridge magnet with the Lord's prayer which he said every day. I held his hand and we prayed together on the street. I prayed to God to protect him. We were joined then by a male who I only know as Alan from this meeting Ian knew him, he may be a friend of Ian's son. He was walking a large brown dog, ie a friendly thing. He's in his late 20s or early 30s. Ian continued to speak about his situation saying "How long is this going to go on? "We're not leaving". I can't remember the exact words spoken I then became aware of a group of about 5 people they all had hoods and scarves up except one who had a partial beard, his face was exposed, he had short hair I believe his hair was brown. The beard was perhaps 5 days stubble, he had sideburns, they were coming from the Templemore Road direction. When they passed the beginning of our church building I thought they were teenagers and covered up as teenagers sometimes would but as they passed by our front door, I realised something more sinister was happening, they were walking with purpose. As they passed the red post box about 15 yards from me, I thought they looked very menacing. Ian turned around, I think he knew what was about to happen, as they started to move now more rapidly towards him he moved towards them. They came into contact together at the pavement on his side of Cluain Place the pavement nearer to our building. I can only describe the men as wearing dark scarves well up over their faces. The smaller among them I think was wearing a grey hoodie. Between their heads up covering their faces and scarves up over the bridge of their noses you couldn't see their faces. The man with the beard looked

know why I think he was in charge but I did feel that, he kept his gaze firmly on what theywere doing. He never looked in my direction. I remember Ogie saying something like "Come on" sort of lets get this over with. Initially I thought it was a punishment beating. They were like a pack of hyenas, they laid into him, they were spread around him, his arms seemed to be held out to the side to disable his arms he couldn't protect himself. They were punching and kicking him his head was down. There was movement from where it started to the middle of the road, the blow still coming down on him. I saw a bat of some description it looked like a baseball bat, it seemed a burgundy colour, a dark colour maybe even purple or brown. They were hitting him at the back and he went down. They continued to attack him and then they started to walk away, the smallest one in the grey hoodie stamped on Ian's head as well as kicking him. He stamped on his head 4-5 times. At that point I shouted to him, as I walked towards him slowly but with intention that he would take note of him, spoke loudly and clearly as if I was instructing him I wasn't yelling. I didn't want to give the impression I was thinking of being a threat to him I said, that's enough, stop, don't stamp on his head anymore, don't stamp on his head or words to that effect. He did then stop. He didn't look at me, just walked briskly off after the others. I believe Alan was standing to my left at this point. My focus was on Ian on the ground, I didn't notice what direction the attackers went I think Alan ran towards Ian's home to get his son. I had no phone with me so I just stayed with him. Ian was wearing a blue hoody which was pulled up over his head almost, his right side was exposed. He was groaning a low growl, he wasn't breathing I thought he was lying as if in the recovery position, I worried if his neck was broken having been stamped on. I lay my hand on his belly and prayed, he let out a couple of groans. There was breath but he wasn't breathing heavily his son Ryan arrived, I asked him to call an Ambulance. He was distressed at the sight of his Dad, he handed me his phone. I rang 999 and asked for an Ambulance and followed all the instructions given to me Ryan was trying to get a response from his Dad and was talking to him. A lot of women came out with fleeces and blankets and were applying them to where Ian was bleeding. There was a pool of blood beside him but not a heavy flow from anywhere. There seemed to be a number of puncture wounds, I don't know if the bat had nails or something to cause such 


Page 4 of 4 injuries. I know someone mentioned seeing a blade but I didn't see any, I continued with all instructions given. As the Ambulance anived, I noticed his eyes half open and glazed. I thought he was gone but hoped he was just knocked out. The Ambulance people got him into the Ambulance and seemed to be doing CPR. On anival of Police, I made myself known to them and informed them that I had been with him. His family werearound and were all hysterical. It was a tenible scene. I was quite shaken up by this, if you didn't have the Lord in your life how do you deal with stuff like this. As I saidI didn't see where the gang went to but I believe they went back in the direction from which they came.

I know Ian Ogle as "Ogie". I am best friends with his son Ryan Johnston who is about twenty two or twenty three years old. Ryan's mum is Vera Johnston, this I think is Ogies girlfriend, I don't think they are married. Ogie lives in 4 Cluain Place. I moved to East Belfast from I was fifteeen and about two or three years later I met Ryan from just hanging about the streets. We have been friends ever since his dad "Ogie" would be a good friend of mine too. If! called round for Ryan and he wasn't in, me and Ogie would have talked ourselves for about a good thirty minutes or so. Me and Ogie would have walked our dogs together every week or so when it suited us. On Sunday 
27th January 2019 I spent the day in my girlfriend Chelsea's housee-.______ We have a wee boy and another wee boy from Chelsea's previous relationship and we put them to bed tonight at about half seven. After putting the kids to bed I played my playstation for a while; about half an hour or so I was playing it, a Fifa game. I then decided to take one of our dogs for a 
walk, it's not a set time or place I take him. I would have left Chelsea's house about 
eight, quarter past eight or so. I left on my own. I was wearing my Adidas tracksuit 
which is dark green colour at the shoulders, then a white stripe through the chest and

Page 2 of6 then the bottom part of it is black. The sleeves are the same, except there are three white stripes at the shoulders. It's a jumper the track bottoms are the same dark green colour with three white stripes down each side that end just before the bottom. There is a small adidas logo on the chest part of the top and the left leg of the thigh. My trainers I wore were green and grey Nike air Max. ----.
We left and I hadt-on his lead, I walked right out of the house onto the Beers Bridge, onto the Woodstock, then right up Castlereagh Place and left onto Castlereagh Street. My dog pulls like mad so we were walking at quite a pace. I was walking towards the Albertbridge Road, and as I got closer I saw "Ogie" standing at the top of Cluain Place. He maybe would have been a hundred metres from me. I'd say that when I saw Ogie I would have been left Chelsea's house about fifteen or twenty minutes. I crossed over the Albert Bridge Road and walked towards were Ogie was standing. He is easily recognisable to me and I noticed he was standing talking to another man who I did not recognise. It was only when I got about twenty metres away from Ogie that he recognised me and nodded to me, I nodded back to him. He was busy talking to the other man. I don't think I've seen him before. Ogle was standing on the footpath on Cluain Place, the other man was standing facing him I did not hear what they were talking about. I said "What's happening" or some greeting like that. Ogie replied alright kid, what's happening" or something like that. The three of us stood there chatting there for what seemed to be about only two minutes. By that stage Ogie was facing down towards Belfast, with his back towards Templemore Avenue direction. It was then that I noticed two or three people running down towards where we were standing. They were running from the Templemore Avenue direction down the Albert Bridge Road, and they were running on the footpath, on the same side of the road as us. When I first saw these people they were about twenty to thirty metres away from where we were standing. They were running towards us in a group. I noticed they all had their faces covered. As they got closer I could see they were wearing hats, scarfs and neck warmers. Ogie must have been blocking out my view of some of them as they were running down towards us, as they got closer instead of two or three people, there was a load of people running towards us. I think about seven. Initially I thought the two or three were joggers, but as I could see more of them I was

Page3 of6 thinking something was wrong. I said to Ogie and the other man something like "Yo, what is that?" Ogie then turned round to face up towards Templemore Avenue. All of the people running at us then got to Ogie. It seemed like there was a wee bit of hesitation but then one of them hit Ogie, I can't remember where the first strike landed but then they all started beating him I had been standing close enough to Ogie for him to be petting my dog, I'm sure that he did. But the time they started hitting him I was about two or three metres away from where they were attacking him. He was beaten a bit while he was standing up, he seemed to be trying to shield himself with his arms, but they beat him to the ground. I can describe some of the people attacking Ogie. One was wearing a grey jacket with the hood up. It had Jong sleeves. I didn't see any motif or any design, it went to his waist. The hood was up, but it didn't cover his face, but I think he had a hat on and something like a scarf or ski mask covering the bottom of his face. His eyes were visible but I can't say any more than that. The grey jacket may be a grey hooded top, it's hard to tell. I can't remember what he was wearing on thebottom half. I think he may have been holding a telescopic flick bat which was a chrome colour. I saw this person who had the flick bat hit Ogie with the flick bat many many times at least thirty, forty, fifty times to the head, face, and shoulders and when he was on the ground he hit him with any space to hit him. I knew all of them were males, but this male with the flick bat spoke to me. I had said "fuck sake lads that's enough". The one with flick bat had stopped took a step towards me and said "it's a fucking nough" then turn back to Ogie and kept repeating "it's a fucking nough" as he hit him over and over. The guy with the flick bat spoke in a deep enough voice. By his voice I would say he was in his late twenties early thirties. It was a local Belfast accent. I did not recognise his voice. One of the others were saying something ' to Ogie as he was beating him, but I can't remember what it was but I could hear it 
� ) ) ) ) was in a local Belfast accent. I did not recognise his voice either. I am about 5 ft 9 or 10, and I think only the man in the grey jacket was about as tall as me. All the rest were smaller and most were stocky. The guy in the grey jacket wasn't stocky looking. Another one of the men attacking Ogie had a long skinny metal rod type thing. It was at least three to three and a half foot Jong. I saw Ogie being struck with this weapon over and over. The man doing this I cannot really describe. I think he was wearing dark clothing. Like the rest of them, he had his face and head covered only his eyes

Page 4 of6 were uncovered. I can't remember anything else about his clothing. He did not speak to me. One of the men was beating Ogie with a baseball bat type thing. It was about two foot long. I can't say what it was made of but it was a base ball bat shaped object. I didn't see what colour it was or if it had any markings on it. I just seen the shape of the bat going down and up, I didn't see whereabouts it was connecting with Ogie's body, but it was definitely hitting him. While they were attacking him, Ogie was crying out, just like "aghh" in pain, I didn't hear him crying out names or anything. His cries didn't make them stop. I remember one ofther men had on a dark coloured beanie hat, with a band round the bottom of it about a half an inch from the bottom of the hat and about two inches wide. It was a lighter or different colour to the rest of the hat, with an emblem in the centre, but I don't know what the design was. He had a scarf covering his face, just his eyes were showing. There was street lights shining down where we were. His scarf appeared yellow or orange but that may have been the effect of the street lights. He was wearing a dark coloured jacket, long sleeved, it did have a zip up the centre. I'm not sure if it had pockets, I didn't see any motifs or designs. It looked a bit more dressy than an anorak. I can't remember the length of this jacket. I do remember this guy was smaller than me by a few inches, but he was built, he was stocky, like a bit of muscle. That was why he stood out. I don't think I heard him speak, he didn't speak to me. I saw this guy jog up with the rest of them and he took part in the attack, but I could not say what he did to Ogie, but not one of them stood there without hitting him. The beating went on for about one minute, with the gang. Then one of them I don't know which one shouted in a Belfast accent. "Right come on lads, camera". There is a camera on the peace wall I think they meant that. The one with the flick bat turned to face me, I think he pointed the flick bat in my direction and said to me "if you fucking say anything you will get the fucking same". During the whole attack I would only have been at the most about five metres away from it all. When the guy with the flick bat said that to me, he would only have been about three metres away from me. I still did not recognise him or his voice. After he said this, all but one of the gang ran offin the direction ofTemplemore A venue. The one that stayed behind repeatedly stamped on Ogie's head with his foot, I think it was his right foot. Ogie's head was on the ground then, and this male was stomping on his head with a lot of force. I was about five metres away from this part of the attack and

Page 5 of6 I didn't see what part of Ogie's head the man's foot was hitting but it was definitely his head. I can't remember if the man was saying anything as he was doing this. This man stamped on Ogie's head at least twenty times, easy. It looked like he was doing it as hard as he could. By this stage Ogie was not saying anything . The others were calling for the man stomping Ogie to come on but the man kept stomping on him, but eventually after about thirty seconds or so he ran in the same direction as the others. The man that was stomping on Ogie's head looked smaller than the rest of the gang; up to my nose in height. He was a slim build, not stocky. It was wearing something tight round my head that was dark coloured. I cannot say whether it was a hood or hat or balaclava but it was tight covering the top of his head. I know they all had their faces covered, he did too but I could not see what with. He had his face down whilst stomping on Ogie. So I didn't even get to see his eyes. I don't think he said anything as he was attacking him. He was wearing a long sleeved dark coloured hoodie or jacket, I can't say any more than that other than I think it came to his waist. He had dark coloured bottoms on. I cannot remember his footwear. I was focused on Ogie when all this was going on. As they all ran off towards the Templemore Avenue direction the road bends to the left and I lost sight of them. The man who had been talking to Ogie before the attack had stood on the spot since the attack took place. He had hardly moved. I don't remember him saying anything when all this was going on. I started shouting to Ogie "are you OK" but there was no response. I don't think I touched him. The man got down beside him and I told him to phone the ambulance. I then ran with my dog to Ogie's house to get Ryan which took a few seconds, the house is that close. I blattered the front door. Ryan stuck his head out the top window. I shouted up to him from the street "Quick, quick, quick they have beat your Dad". Ryan asked me who I just said "a load of masked men". I told him that his dad was just lying there and to hurry up. Ryan was out of his house in a minute. He wanted to take a baseball bat but I talked him out of it and we both ran up to where Ogie was still lying where I'd left him with the man. I found out later this man was a minister. Ryan told me to phone his mum Vera. I have checked my mobile, and I rang her at 21 :22 hours. Ryan was on the ground calling his dad's name and trying to shake him to wake him up. When I phoned Vera and told her that Ian had been beaten by a load of masked men and he was in a really bad way and wouldn't wake up. She asked where it happened. I told

Page 6 of6 her at the top of her street. She said she was coming now. Vera arrived a couple of minutes later, in Emma Dryburgh's car, it's like a jeep people carrier type thing. Emma is Vera's niece I think. Emma was driving. Emma, Vera, Ryan's girlfriend Lisa Mac Areevy and Ian's daughter Toni Johnston all got out ofEmma's car. Toni was in hysterics. Vera and Emma told me that they saw a load of men running with masks on and they got into a black Seat Leon car. Emma's car has dash cam and she was on the phone to police when the ambulance arrived, which was about a good ten minutes from Ryan got to his dad. Before the ambulance arrived, I think the minister had taken Ogie's top off, because I remember seeing injuries to his back and his arm. His back looked sliced. It looked like he had two stab wounds to one of his arms, I can't remember which one. There was blood everywhere and all over the street. His face was just mangled all red with blood. The police arrived after the ambulance and cordoned the area off. There is a church on the Albert _Bridge Road and the minister and some Scottish man who was making cups tea in the church, they took us in there. Police where there too and I gave my details to them. I had left my dog back to my girlfriend's before going back to down check on Ryan and Vera. Vera went into the ambulance with Ogie, Ryan was in the church. I do not know who these men are that attacked Ogie. It was vicious attack and to me they really meant to hurt or kill him. I didn't get to see these men's faces, there was no names mentioned between them. None of these men did anything distinctive that would help me recognise them again.

---------. A friend collected me from work and dropped me off at McDonald's, Connswater. From McDonalds I walked home. I was home for around ten minutes when I decided to ring my mother. I have no credit on my mobile telephone so I decided to use the public payphone. The payphone is just outside the front door ofKEEN's. I don't know the name of the road but it runs from Central Station to Connswater. Walking to the telephone box there was no one else about except for two persons standing at a Glider stop, that I had to walk past. These two appeared to be boyfriend and girlfriend. They were about sixteen or seventeen years old. She had blonde hair. I cannot recall anything else about them. It was around8.45 pm when I got to the telephone box. I tried to ring my mother but she did not answer. I would add that as I was walking to the phone box, on the same side as the phone box, and before I got to the Glider stop, there were two men, both aged 35-40 years. They were standing talking. One was wearing a blue t� shirt and was slightly chubby. I cannot recall any further detail or describe the other. I nodded to them as I walked past and the one in the blue I-shirt nodded back. I did not

Page 2 of3 recognise them. Whilst I was in the telephone box I observed a group offive or six males. They appeared to be wearing hoodies. They came from the road which runs down the side ofKEEN's. None of them would have been more than 5'8" in height. As they came towards the telephone box they picked up pace. Once they passed me their pace really quicked up. I looked out of the telephone box (I would be looking roughly in the direction of Central Station. One of the males was carrying a knife in his back pocket. I could see the blade. The knife handle was in his pocket with the knife protrudring. I cannot recall this male nor any of his clothing. I am a chef and the knife attracted my attention. I would say that the make of the knife was "Global" and it had a 7-9" blade. These men started running towards the two men. As they approached them they produced what I call batons. These were pieces of wood or metal, I can't say which, nor can I say where they produced them from. These men attacked the man in the blue t-shirt. They gave him a good hammering for what I reckon was less than 2 minutes. The man in the blue t-shirt was kicked and punched to the ground and hit with the batons. I did not see him being stabbed. There was no verbal exchange prior to this and the man in the blue t-shirt did not try to run away. Whilst this was going on the two who were in the Glider stop ran away, roughly in the direction of Connswater. The fight was finished and the men were walking back towards me. I left the telephone box, crossed the road, walked up to the next junction and turned right to walk the long way home. I turned back. The men had returned back the way they came, but running away. I walked past the injured man, but on the other side of the road. The injured man was not saying anything. I walked home. I heard sirens. After maybe ten minutes I walked down to the junction, where Police were, and told them what I had seen. I would confirm that none of the persons were known to me nor would I recognise any of them again. I cannot give a better description of any of them. I would also clarify that when I left the phone box I walked to Russells to buy some groceries. I returned back once I got my groceries and this is when I walked past the injured person. I did not see his friend that he had been talking to earlier but I did hear someone shout "Paddy's dead".

!---------had a swim session 
---at the Templemore Baths Templemore Avenue from 8 pm to 9 
pm. This was the case earlier which would have been Sunday 27th January 2019. 
There were seventeen ofus there in total including my wife Sharon __ _ 
----Sharon and I stood outside talking to Aaron and Alison 
Noble ____h___ This would have been around 
9.20 pm. I was standing on the footpath ofTemplemore Avenue with my back towards the Baths. Sharon Alison and Aaron were in front of me with their backs toward the road. It was a cool but settled and clear evening. It was dark but the street lights were on and the one above us or on our side of the road was flickering. I wear glasses and had them on at the time. I was wearing a black short coat with a Templemore badge on the left breast. I had blue tracksuit bottoms and dark track shoes with a white sole. I am 5'8h" in height and heavy build. The traffic on the road was quiet. Myca.h--------.-was parked around 20 yards to my left on the Templemore Avenue facing the Newtownards Roadh. I noticed on the other side of the road Mervin Gibson's car

Page 2 of3 parked outside his house. He is a minister and was facing the baths. The car is a dark grey Vauxhall MPV. This car was around 40 ft from me I had a clear unobstructed view and noticed a male walking quickly on the far side of the road from us and on the footpath. I first noticed him as he passed the front of Mervin's car. This male I will call male No. 1 was of thin build and around 5'8" or 5'9" in height. He was wearing a grey or light coat with a hood which was up over his head. There was a reflective strip on the inside of his left arm that I noticed as he walked. There was a stripe on the outside of his trousers but I cannot say for definite what colour this was. I am only conscious of the fact it was different from the rest of the trouser material. His face was completely covered but I can't say what with other than I couldn't see any features at all, and it appeared black. He was walking towards the Newtownards Road. As he approached the rear of the Vauxhall MPV he turned towards Albertbridge Road and shouted back up the road in that direction. I couldn't make out what he shouted but it sounded like a local Belfast accent. I said to Sharon and Aaron and Alison to look at this guy because he looked suspicious. They all turned to look towards him. When this male reached the comer of Langtree Court he stopped and I then noticed a second male coming from the same direction on the same footpath. I will describe this male as Male No.e2. This male was slightly shorter than the first at around 5'6" or 5'7" and of heavier build than the first but not big. He was wearing black trousers and a black coat. The coat had a hood and the hood was up over his head. He had a scarf over the lower half of his face. I believe the scarf was lighter in colour than his coat. Just his eyes were visible. I also had a clear view of Male No. 2. I noticed he was holding a knife in his hand I cannot be sure which hand it was in. I only noticed the knife when he joined Male No. 1 at the junction of Langtree. The knife was shining in the light with a metal coloured blade which looked to be around 8" in length with a straight edge on one side and a curved other side, which appeared to have indentation on the edged surfaces. Male number 2 turned around to face Albertbridge Road and I looked and saw a further three males, who were walking on the same footpath towards male I and 2. Male 1 and 2 walked off along Templemore A venue and up Madrid Street and out of sight. I would estimate that I watched males 1 and 2 for around 30 seconds in total. The second group of three males didn't appear to be in any hurry. I watched them as they calmly walked into Langtree Court and all three got into a car that was

Page 3 of3 parked facing into the cul-de-sac of Langtree Court. The car started up, it was parked on the double yellow lines along the side of the church hall, I now remember it was actually facing Templemore Avenue and not facing into the Court. The car drove out normally and turned left towards the Newtownards Road down Templemore Avenue. They then turned right into a side street which I think was 2 or 3 streets. up from the Baths. This was the last time I saw the males or indeed the car. At no time were the second group of three standing with male I and 2 but it was clear they were associated together. My attention was more on the knife and as such all I can say about the group of three was that they all had hoods up and faces covered. Aaron rang 999 to report the knife and the fact we believed something could be about to happen. This was just before the car drove off Aaron asked Alison to get the registration number of the car which she repeated as JGZ7406. I could see the car as being a fresh looking 5 door Seat. Sharon and I parted company with Aaron and Alison we went to our car. I drove around the street to the rear of the Baths and onto Albertbridge and turned right towards the City. I could see a blonde girl who had walked past us as we stood talking outside the Baths, she was now walking citywards in front of the chemist shop. There was also a dark haired male at the Glider bus stop. I noticed an ambulance near the entrance to Cluan Place. I saw a figure lying on the ground next to the junction. There were jackets covering this person and several females standing next to the figure on the ground. I assumed the males that I had seen on Templemore Avenue were in some way connected. At 21.30 I telephoned Alison Noble and told her about the ambulance. I told her I would report it when I got home. When I arrived home I rang 10 I at 21.36 from my mobile --. I remember a dog walker on the Templemore Avenue he was walking a really fat white dog.

On Sunday 27th January 2019 I was at Templemore Swimming Centre, Templemore 
Avenue Belfast at a swim sessio..,WfflllllWWW.The session 
ended at 9 pm and I got changed and left the centre with my husband Gary Proctor, 
WW WAlison Noble and her husband Aaron Noble. We WW 
WWW WW were talking outside on the footpath at around 9.15 
pm. I had my back to the road, but my husband remarked on someone on the other 
side of the road. I turned to see a male wearing a pale grey 2 piece tracksuit with the 
hood up. The tracksuit had a pale-coloured broad single stripe on the leg. I would 
estimate that the male was around 5'9" tall and of medium build. I first saw this male 
when he was level with us on the opposite side ofTemplemore Avenue. He was 
walking quickly, but not running. I was not able to see this male's face. I heard him 
talk loudly to someone coming behind him and I looked to see who he was talking to. 
I then saw that a second male in all dark clothing, with a scarf covering his face above 
his nose but below his eyes, and with his hood up. The face covering was also dark 
coloured. This male was also around the same height of the first male and of similar 
build. I could also see that this second male was carrying a large knife, with a blade of

Page 2 of2 around 8 inches long silver coloured -it was reflecting light in the street -the knife had a curved edge and a black handle. The male was carrying the knife in his right hand down by his side. I said "look at the size of that", referring to the knife. I then saw some more men coming along behind the 2nd male, along Templemore Ave -I cannot remember how many or anything about these men, however it seemed to me that all the men knew each other -I think that the group may have talked to the 2nd male with the knife but I cannot recall what was said. I saw the group of men then get into a black carabout the size of a Seat Ibiza. The car looked like a fairly newish, good car. The car had been parked offTemplemore Ave in a side street opposite the swim centre, with it's nose in. I saw the car reverse out onto Templemore Avenue and drive off towards Newtownards Rd at a normal pace. The car turned right further along Templemore Avenue, but I'm not sure which right tum it took. I didn't notice anything else about the car as it drove away from my position. I can't recall the registration. The first 2 males continued walking along Templemore Avenue, towards Newtownards Rd but I don't know where they went. I would estimate that all the males I saw were aged in their late teens to early 20s. The males were in my view for several minutes and my view across Templemore Avenue was unobstructed. The street was lit, but the one immediately to my right flickered on and off a few times. The weather while we were outside was dry but cold. Aaron phoned 999 to report what was going on and my husband and I left Alison and Aaron, got into our car, which was parked nearby and drove home. My husband also rang Police once we were home.

On Sunday 27th January 2019, I was at Templemore Swimming Baths, Templemore Avenue, Belfast from approximately 7.45 pm. I was with my wife, Alison Noble. 
--. At about 9.20 pm, I was present _____ --at the front of the swimming baths. Alison was with me and Gary and Sharon Proctor were also the1 _______ _ IIIIIIII_IIII_______Jhadtmyback 
to the road. At this point, I heard some people yelling. It sounded like there were about 3 voices shouting. I could not make out what was being said. It could have been slang language. The accents were broad Belfast accents. I turned around and saw a number of people running on the pavement on the opposite side of the road to me. There seemed to be two separate groups of males running. There were either 4 or 5 in each group so between 8-10 persons in total. I thought they were two groups as there was a gap of about 5 metres between them and they each headed off in different directions. The first group of 4 or 5 were slightly spread out in their running. They were running in the direction ofNewtownards Road, from Albertbridge Road

Page 2 of3 direction. As they ran across the junction of Langtry Court, I noticed one of the males was carrying a knife in his right hand while he was running. It had a large blade of approximately 6-9 inches in length and a depth of about 2 inches. I did not see any reflection coming off the knife so I could not say if it was silver. It may have been a dark coloured blade. The male had it sticking out directly in front of him as he ran. I did not see any blood on it. I then noticed all of the persons were wearing either balaclavas or scarves around their heads. I did not get a look at any of their faces and could not even see their hair. They were all wearing dark clothing and I did not notice any distinctive motifs, logos or patterns of anyone's clothing. I would say the group gave me the impression that they were in the 18-21 year old age range. They were all running quite fast and seemed relatively fit. They all appeared lean in build and appeared taller than me. I am 5'6" and I would say they were all 5'8" and above..
-, ___ . They seemed like the normal youths we would generally see about at weekends. Their mannerisms and style of movement made me think they were in this age bracket. As the first group ran past Langtry Court, I had an unobstructed view ofthem as there are double yellow lines there and there were no cars parked on the road at that point, amber street lighting was on so I had good visibility and am certain I saw a knife. The group were about 15-20 metres away from me when I saw the knife. I would say the road width in Templemore Avenue would be 10-12 metres. I had viewed the males for a few seconds before I noticed the knife. From I first heard the yelling until they crossed Langtry Court, would have taken 
.eabout 10 seconds in total. I wear glasses to drive and I was not wearing them �al the time but I am clear about what I saw. The first group of males continued running and then turned left into Madrid Street. I didn't see or hear them again. the second group of 4 or 5 males then ran into Langtry Court and got into a vehicle. In terms of descriptions, there is nothing to differentiate the two groups. Everyone was built similarly and dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered. I would say they were also the same age and height as the first group. I did not notice anyone in this group carrying anything. The car they got into was parked on the right hand side of the road in Langtry Court, approximately 10 metres in from the junction. It's back end was facing out towards Templemore Avenue. I did not see which male got into the driver's

Page 3 of3 seat but the group of 4 or 5 all got into the car and it moved off. It did not move at excessive speed and you would not have got the impression they were fleeing from anything. The car was driven down to the end of Langtry Court, where it turned by the apartment. and came back onto Templemore Avenue and turned left. The lights were on. The car was driven down towards Newtownards Road and I saw it take a right tum into what I think was Major Street. No indicators were used at the time. From the start of the yelling, to the car turning here, was approximately 30-45 seconds, in duration. The car was a black Seat Leon. I believe the registration was JGZ7406. I could not make it out without my glasses and I asked my wife to call it out to me. There was nothing else distinctive about the car. It looked quite clear and shiny and looked pretty new. It sounded like a petrol engine as it was quite quiet. I did not see the vehicle again after it turned into Major Street. I checked Google Maps on my phone to help me with the street names so I am confident in my references. I am almost certain it was Major Street, the car turned into. It was 70-100 metres passed the school on Templemore Avenue anyway. From my phone records, I phoned Police at 
9.22 pm. I then left the area ________ . I went in Albertbridge Road direction. I did not see anything else suspicious on my way home. I did not see any vehicle come out of Madrid Street, where the first group of males ran, so I do not believe they left in a car. I would have noticed if a car came out of the junction there. For reference I was wearing light blue jeans and a light grey zip.up waterproof jacket with a hood. I had dark training shoes with orange laces on. My wife was wearing a dark coloured jacket with a hood, dark tracksuit bottoms and dark trainers. I could not say what Gary or Sharon were wearing. There is no CCTV at the Templemore Swimming Baths. To clarify, when I left Templemore A venue, I went to the traffic lights at Albertbridge continuing straight ahead onto Castlereagh Street and then onto Castlereagh Road. At no point did I see any injured party and I only became aware someone had been stabbed when Police contacted me. A Noble

On the 27th January 2019 (Sunday) I was standing outside Templemore Swim Centre on the Templemore Av. Belfast. I was with my husband Aaron Noble and friends Gary Proctor and Sharon Proctor. It was around 9.20 pm as I stopped swimming at 
9.00 pm and it would take me that to get ready. As I was standing outside I remember it was cold and yet dry. It was dark outside but due to the street lighting in the area I could see clearly in both directions though I will add that the light on my side of the road in front of me was turning off and on that a flicker but on and off every 10-15 seconds. We were standing outside for just around 2-3 minutes chatting and I noticed persons on the opposite side of the road and coming from the Albert Bridge direction. The persons when I first seen them were passing the houses next to Keens Shop. I would say at about level with the 4th house. These persons really took my attention as I seen that they were wearing balaclavas. The persons I believe were men and the way they were moving they appeared to be young and fast on their feet not carrying any weight. They were also making noise by saying something but I could not tell what they were communicating with each other but I cannot say what, with what accent or anything like that. They passed us and never looked our direction at any point. They

Page 2 of3 ran right past us on the other side and down the street to the left after. Our location I know that this is called Madrid Street. When I first noticed them until they went into Madrid Street I would say this took around 30 seconds in total. There are no obstructions in my line of sight for the duration of my observations. I did not recognise these people and do not believe I could identify any of them I would say they were all about the same height and build. None of them stood out as different. They were all appeared to be average height and were of slim build. The first had a balaclava on with two separate holes for the eyes and none for the mouth. The balaclava was black/dark coloured. He had long sleeve top on that's all I can say. The second also wore a balaclava the same as the first, this man had a knife in his left hand. The knife handle was in his hand and the blade was backwards up his arm as if holding the knife upside down or the wrong way. The knife appeared to be dark in colour as if in a sheath or dark coloured but did not appear to be shiny silver. This man was wearing track bottoms that appeared to have the cuffs at the bottom. The other two wore what appeared to be scarfs they appeared to be lighter in colour not black and I think they had their hoods up. They all ran in single file and were all wearing trainers but I can't describe anything else about them. When they left my line of sight my attention went to a car that was parked directly across from me. I believe this area is Langtry Court. The car was parked on the right hand side of the road. All 4 doors of the car opened and they piled in. All doors closed again and the car drove up into Langtry Court and turned. I believe this court is a dead end. The car came towards us after turning and stopped at the giveway. It did give way before turning left onto Templemore Avenue and driving down the street before taking the second tum on the right and I have no idea what that road is called. From the moment I saw the car until it went out of sight was about 1 minute. The car was fairly new and was a black Seat Leon. I took the reg down on my phone and have shown it to D/C O'Donnell. It was JGZ7406 and I text this to my husband Aaron at 21.34. This was right at the time the car was leaving. My mobile number is -and Aaron's is 
MUI The car was very clean I would say and the number plate was clearly visible. The car was only the road width away and I looked at both the front and back plates, they were the same. The plates appeared to be standard plates. The car drove at a normal speed throughout. The only thing I can say about the occupants of the car was

Page 3 of3 that one of the persons had a lighter top on than the rest. I would say he got into the drivers side of the car. I would say they were also men but that's it. The car was no more than 5 metres off the Templemore Avenue and therefore only around 15 metres from me. I was fixed on the registration of the car and never looked at the driver or passengers as they approached and turned away. I would that the 4 running appeared to be looking back and communicating with each other as they ran. As the men drove offin one car Aaron rang 999 and called Police. This was totally out of the ordinary and men in balaclavas around Belfast usually means trouble.

I am a paramedic employed by Northern Ireland Ambulance Service currently based in Banbridge. On Sunday 27 January 2019 I was working an 8 to 8 shift thats 8 pm to 8 am with my colleague Mark Reynolds. We were not long on duty when we got our second caJJ of the night it was a report ofa man attacked in Cluan Place Belfast. We were only about two minutes away when the caJJ came in, I'm not sure of the name of the road but we were coming round from Bridge End, the road sweeps round and Cluan Place is in front of you. I made a radio transmission to ask if it was safe for us to go in and was told on the radio that the attackers were away and we were safe to go ahead. When we arrived I opened the door and was met by a bloke with a dog which was pulling towards me. I told him to get the dog back, he did this and I could see at least ten people. It was crazy, they were screaming and shouting, I'd say it was half women and halfmen. I definitely heard someone say "this was the UVF!" The victim was lying on the ground on his back. I knew straightaway from experience that he was dead, we had known from the radio report that he was unconscious and not breathing. I attached the monitor and tried to get a line in but it was too dark to see properly and there were so many people around that Mark and I got the scoop which is a stretcher

I remember the blood was pumping out of him and I saw stab wounds on his shoulder possibly the right but I can't be sure. The only thing I remember about his clothes was his Union Jack socks. He never showed any signs of life while I was with him. I can't remember if it was raining that night, I do remember how dark it was though.

I am a paramedic with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and have been since 2005. I have worked in Bridge End Ambulance Station since 2010. In January 2019, I cannot recall the specific date but it could all be recorded on the patient report form and call logs held at NIAS Headquarters, I would have started working at around 1930 or 2000 hours and recall that I was working with Dax Galloway. I was driver and he was attendant on this particular evening. Sometime before midnight we were tasked to a male having been assaulted by masked men with iron bars at a particular address in Cluan Place, Belfast. My colleague asked via radio transmission if Police were attending and we were advised that there were no crews available at that particular 
time. That we would likely get there first and not to delay as the male was unconscious. We were on our way from Annadale Avenue towards the City Centre 
when we received the call so it would have taken us only 4-5 minutes or so to get to 
Cluan Place. When we arrived there was a group of males and females standing 
around a male lying unconscious on his back on the ground. He was on the left hand 
side of the road at the junction between the Albertbridge Road and Cluan Place, half 
on halfoff the road. There were various items of clothing and other things such as

Page 2 of3 facecloths etc. That people had placed underneath his head and on top of him. He was in a puddle of blood and there was blood all over him but it wasn't immediately apparent where it was coming from, Dax approached the male with a defib and I followed behind with a stretcher. As Dax was attaching the defibrilator I said to put the male onto the stretcher and do it in the back of the ambulance. This was firstly for our safety as there was a large crowd of people and because the lighting is better in the ambulance. When I looked at him I thought that he looked as ifhe was already dead, that he had already bled to death. Myself, Dax and two male members of the public helped set him onto the stretcher and into the ambulance. There were multiple stab wounds on his back, too many for us to count with any accuracy at the time, from recollection I also think there was an injury to the back of his head and there wa. blood coming from his mouth when we commenced Basic Life Support/Advanced Life Support (BLS/ALS) indicating there was blood in his airway. Police had arrived at This stage, one Police Officer got into the back of the ambulance and was assisting us. Dax managed the males airway, the Police Officer continued chest compressions and I was administering drugs. Once this was set up I got into the drivers seat and we conveyed the male to the Royal Victoria Hospital. We had established that the male was called Ian Ogle and his partner came with us in the front passenger seat of the Ambulance. The whole way to the hospital she kept saying that the UVF had done it, that it had been ongoing for a year and that either her son or Ian Ogle's son had been beaten in a bar by the same people and that they had been tortured ever since. She made a comment that they would get away with it. We arrived at the RVH within less than 5 minutes I imagine and wheeled him into A&E on the stretcher where we handed over to medical staff. Dax completed the handover while I returned the kit back to the Ambulance. We were told to lock up the ambulance and wait for Police CID to arrive so we remained for several hours until Police arrived. At no point when Ian Ogle was in our care did he show any sign of life.

Whilst during patrol, at approximately 2140 hrs I overheard Belfast Regional Control task a call sign to Cluan Place, Belfast as there had been a report of someone having been stabbed. As 

;,; we made our way towards that direction I heard Constable Fox asking for additional call signs as it was 'looking like a fatal'. On arrival to Albertbridge Road at the 
junction of Cluan Place I observed an ambulance in attendance. I also saw a crowd of approximately 15 to 20 people on the Albertbridge Road at the junction of Cluan Place. Tensions appeared quite high. I spoke to Constable Fox who stated that the male was in the rear of the ambulance and the crew were currently working on him. He stated they will need escorted to the Hospital. I informed him we would sort that out. I arranged for another crew member to join us, Constable Martin. I opened the 
rear door of the ambulance to speak to the paramedics. I observed they were doing 
CPR on a male I now know to be Ian Ogle. They asked for a police officer to travel 
with a paramedic in the rear. Constable O'Rourke volunteered and travelled in the

I am a Constable in the Police ofNorthem Ireland currently attached to Strandtown Police Station in the city of Belfast. On Sunday 27th January 2019 I was on duty and in uniform carrying out mobile patrol duties with Constable Kane. At approximately 2130 hours I attended to the report of an assault at Cluan Place Belfast. I spoke to Constable Fox who was attempting to secure a scene at the entrance to Cluan Place. I observed a hostile crowd of about 20 people who were shouting at Constable Fox. Constable Fox asked ifl could contain and prevent this crowd from entering the scene. As I contained the crowd Constable Kane informed be that the paramedics required someone to accompany them in the ambulance to the Royal Victoria Hospital, I informed her that I would go with them. Constable Martin then accompanied Constable Kane in the vehicle. I entered the ambulance and the paramedic Dix Galoway asked me if! knew CPR, I said I did and he asked me to take over. He remained at the head of the victim whom I recognised as Ian Ogle of Cluan

Page 2 of2 Place. I have known Mr Ogle for approximately 6 years. I commenced CPR. A few minutes later the ambulance commenced an emergency blue light run to the Royal Victoria Hospital. As I performed CPR, blood expelled from Mr Ogle's oral cavity with every compression. The paramedic continued with a bag valve mask and suction. On a number of occasions I lost my footing due to sliding on the blood on the floor of the ambulance. I also lost my balance and had to grab a hand rail. On one occasion Mr Ogle's right arm slid off the trolley. I lifted his arm and placed it by his side. His arm felt cold and clammy. As a result of losing my balance I have injured my left knee and elbow. On the arrival at the Royal Victoria Hospital Mr Ogle was taken to a cubicle area by the accident and emergency staff. At approximately 2225 hours the A&E Sister informed Constable Martin and me that Mr Ogle had been pronounced dead. Duringthis time approximately 20 family members had arrived. They were very vocal blaming paramilitaries for his death, his daughter Toni stated that she would be announcing his death on social media, so people knew the truth. At this point I was contacted by radio to maintain the ambulance and cubicle as two scenes. I had already secured the ambulance and explained to the A&E Sister what was occurring. At approximately 0030 hours D/Constable Mark Wilson attended the RVH. I explained what had occurred and escorted him to the ambulance and the cubicle containing Mr Ogle's remains. D/Constable Wilson agreed that Mr Ogle's remains could be moved to another secure room to allow the cubicle to be freed up to receive patients. Constable Martin and I waited with Mr Ogle whilst CSI commenced their examination of the deceased. At approximately 0450 hours I accompanied Mr Ogle's remains to the forensic mortuary.

I am a registered medical practitioner with the qualifications MB BCh FRCPath DMJ(Path), Assistant State Pathologist and Honorary Clinical Lecturer in Forensic Medicine at the Queen's University of Belfast. At 2.45 p.m. on March 5, 2019 I was visited in the State Pathologist's Department by D. Insp. M. Griffin and M.C.F.A. Rosie Johnston. The purpose of the visit was to show me some weapons which had been recovered from Connswater River not far from where Mr Ogle had been murdered. One was a gold coloured retractable metal baton with a black handle. There were no injuries on the deceased consistent with tramline bruising as if caused by such a weapon. The other was a knife sealed within a police evidence bag and placed within a cylindrical clear sharps tube. It was a single bladed weapon with a non serrated edge. The following approximate measurements were taken with the knife still within the police evidence bag. The knife was 33 cm. long. The handle measured up to 13 cm. long and was black in colour with three silver coloured metal rivets. The blade of the weapon was 20 cm. long. The blade of the weapon was pointed and broadened rapidly up to a maximum of 4.2 cm. at the hilt. At 14 cm. from its tip the 

Page 2 of2 weapon was about 34.5 cm. broad. In my opinion this knife could have been that 
which caused the fatal injury to Mr I. H. Ogle. 
This report has been prepared on the basis of the autopsy findings and other additional investigations carried out by me or under my direction. A full record of the notes, or a transcription of the dictation, made at the time of the autopsy is available for inspection. A record of samples retained at the autopsy is also also available.

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The results of the analysis will generally represent the situation at the time of death. If any of the information I have been provided with changes at a later date it may be necessary to re-evaluate the Interpretation. 
ETHANOL (ALCOHOL) The presence of ethanol (alcohol) in Mr OGLE's post-mortem blood and urine specimens (128 mg/dL and 179 mg/dL, respectively) demonstrates that he had consumed alcohol at some point prior to death. The effect that a blood alcohol concentration of 128 mg/dL would have had on the deceased would have largely depended on his tolerance to ethanol. Nevertheless, a blood alcohol concentration of this order could be expected to cause a degree of intoxication in a normal, social drinker but not serious or toxic effects. Effects may include impaired coordination, impaired balance, reduced inhibitions, slurred speech and increased talkativeness. The effects of ethanol would be less pronounced in a regular/heavy drinker. II should be noted that the blood alcohol concentration may have been slightly affected by the blood transfusion given in hospital but is broadly comparable to the urine alcohol concentration. For reference, the prescribed legal limit for driving is 80 mg/dL in blood, whilst fatalities are typically observed in cases with concentrations greater than 350 mg/dL. 
OPIATES The indicated presence of codeine and a morphine metabolite, morphine-3.glucuoronide (M3G) in the post-mortem urine, but their absence in the blood, would suggest previous rather than recent use of morphine, or a drug that breaks down to morphine (e.g. codeine and diamorphine (heroin)). In this case, the findings could be from the sole use of codeine, which I understand was prescribed to the deceased in the form of "Co-codamol". 
DIAZEPAM 
Diazepam is a prescription only benzodiazepine drug which is prescribed for anxiety and insomnia. It is also subject to abuse. The indicated presence of diazepam (trace amount) in the post-mortem blood could be consistent with low therapeutic use/previous use and does not indicate recent excessive use in the hours prior to death. However, the concentration was too low to unequivocally determine its presence. 





INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS (CONT'D) 
PARACETAMOL, PROPANOLOL and QUETIAPINE The presence of paracetamol, propranolol (trace amount) and quetiapine in the post.mortem blood sample demonstrates the use of these drugs prior to death, The observed low concentrations would be consistent with therapeutic dosage. Paracetamol is a widely available analgesic drug (pain killer), Propranolol is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina. Quetlapine is an anti-psychotic drug. 
FLUOXETINE The presence of fluoxetine in the post-mortem blood demonstrates the use of this drug prior to death. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant drug prescribed for the treatment of depressive disorders. 
For reference, although not directly comparable to post-mortem blood, 24 patients receiving 20-60 mg daily dose of fluoxetine developed a steady state serum concentrations averaging 0.11 mg/L (range 0.03-0.47 mg/L). A similar study of 13 adult patients receiving the same dose produced steady-state serum levels of 0.06 to 0.45 (average 0.23 mg/L). Fluoxetine is believed to have a relatively high therapeutic margin and fatalities have been associated with concentrations greater than 2 mg/L. 
Therefore, in this case the concentrations of fluoxetine (0. 79 mg/L) and its primary metabolite norfluoxetine (0.78 mg/L) measured in the post-mortem femoral blood could be consistent with chronic therapeutic dosage (allowing for post-mortem changes) and does not necessarily suggest excessive use of this drug. 
OTHER DRUGS 
There was no evidence to indicate that Mr OGLE had taken any of the other drugs included within the scope of the analysis, shortly prior to death. As a general guide the majority of drugs can be detected for 12 to 24 hours in blood and 24 to 48 hours in urine, after last use, but this depends on many factors such as certain chemical properties of the drug (e.g. stability within biological fluid), dosage, frequency of use, individual variation in the rates of metabolism/excretion of drugs and the sensitivity of the technique(s) used to detect the drugs.

I am a Detective Constable in the Police Service of Northern Ireland presently attached to Crime Operations, Ladas Drive, Belfast. 
I have attended and completed the PSNI Core Skills in Mobile Phone Examinations Course. I have also been certified in the use of the Cellebrite Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED) and Cellebrite Logical Analyser software. I have also completed the PSNI Intermediate Skills in Mobile Phone Examinations Course. 
On 30th January 2019t1 received exhibit JBl, a Samsung mobile phone from Constable J Bingham of Crime Operations department. I signed and dated the exhibit label accordingly. This exhibit was assigned Case Reference P00i719C201. I then commenced an examination of this exhibit. 



Page 2 of9 I conducted the examination of exhibit JB I using a combination of a Faraday Box and SIM Access Card, which prevents a mobile device accessing Cellular and Wi-Fi networks. 



I then extracted data from the handset, SIM Card and/or Memory Card using forensic software. 
At the end of my examination I returned the exhibit JBJ to the EDO H Hoffin. 
Contemporaneous records were kept of these examinations which are retained at Ladas Drive, Belfast

I am a Detective Constable in the Police Service of Northern Ireland presently attached Serious Crime Branch. On Wednesday 15th May 2019 I was on duty and part of the investigation team into the murder of Ian Ogle. During the investigation the mobile telephone number 07895982290 was identified as being used by one of the suspects. I entered this number into a police issue mobile and stored it as a contact. I then opened the application Whatsapp. Whatsapp can be used for messaging and calls but it enables you to add a profile picture to the account. I opened the contact 07895982290 and looked at the profile picture associated with it. The picture was of a male and a female. I immediately recognised the male as Walter Alan Ervine, date of birth 14/05/1981 of 40 Cuba Walk. I did not recognise the female in the picture. I took a screen shot on the police phone of the profile picture relating to 07895982290. I also took a screen shot of the phone number and picture belonging to the Whatsapp account. I then emailed both screen shots to my police email. At 1535 hours I printed the email containing the two attachments and marked this EF43. I then printed the screen shot containing the telephone number 07895982290 and the picture and marked this EF44. I then printed the screen shot of the profile picture and marked this

Telefonica UK Limited Court Disclosure 

T 08444 632640 Philip Stevenson Police Service of Northern Ireland, 65 Knock road, Belfast BT5 6 LD 
9/8/2019 Dear Sirs, 
!'our Ref: 98/422/19/2/CO/2A **STA**-1 Our Ref: 338688 
With regard to the above case, Telefonica UK Limited is supplying evidence obtained from computer records along with a statement complying with (CJ Act 1967, s.9; MC Act 1980, ss.5A(3) 
(a) & 5B; Criminal Procedure Rules 2005, Rule 27.1). Our statements have been developed so that all common legal questions are addressed and I would expect that there will be no requirement for a witness to attend Court. 
It is possible (s31 Criminal Procedure & Investigations Act 1996 for the Judge to make a ruling on admissibility of evidence and matters of law at the plea and directions hearing, could you please copy this letter to the CPS and ask them to make every effort to agree Telefonica Limited evidence. (It may even be that s1 O Criminal Justice Act 1967 "Proof by formal admission" could be used to avoid court attendancee/ revision to the witness statement). 
If the Court requires any additional information, we can supply this in a separate Witness tatement to an appropriate officer. In this way, I would hope to minimise the impact on both Telefonica UK Limited and the Court. 
If a subsequent witness summons is issued, I will assume that is for the purpose of supplying additional information that can only be supplied in person. 
Please note that Telefonica UK Limited may seek a "Wasted Costs Order" should a Telefonica UK Limited e ee be called to court unnecessarily.

Page 5 of8 Item 38 (GE3) was an Adidas trainer for the left foot, on which no blood was found. The laces and the inner heel were sampled for DNA profiling; a predominant profile, matching that of Mark Sewell, was obtained from both samples. Additional DNA components were present at a low level. 
DNA was extracted from these samples and tested using the DNA 17 system. This method types DNA using seventeen simultaneous tests (including those of the SGMPlus system), one of which determines the gender of the sample donor. The interpretation and statistical analysis of some of the mixed profiles was performed using STRmix�software. The profiling results are held on file. 
Comment 
The profiles obtained from the right Nike trainer laces (Item 4 GB 1) and the left Nike trainer inner heel (Item 5 GB2) were found to be mixed DNA profiles from at least three individuals. Jonathan Brown's DNA characteristics were represented in the mixtures and accordingly he could be one of the contributors. 
In order to help the Court evaluate this finding, I have considered two propositions: 
I. That the DNA in the mixtures came from Jonathan Brown and two unknown individuals 
2. That the DNA in the mixture came from three unknown unrelated individuals

Predominant profiles, matching that of Mark Sewell, were obtained from the inner heel and laces samples recovered from the right adidas trainer (Item 37 GE2) and the left Adidas trainer (Item 38 GE3). Accordingly he could be a source of the DNA.

My examination, interpretation and any opinions expressed in this report are based on the information made available to me the time of examination. Should additional relevant information become available then I may need to reconsider my findings and interpretation in relation to this.

I made Mr Brown aware ofmy identity and informed him that I was arresting him for the murder of Ian Ogle which occurred on Sunday 27th January 2019 in East Belfast. I caution him in the following manner. You do not have to say anything, but I must caution you that if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court it may harm your defence. If you do say anything it may be given in evidence. He made no reply after caution. At I 920 hours Mr Brown stated that he had arranged with his solicitor to return to Northern Ireland as he wanted to clear his name. At 1926 hours Mr Brown stated that he was not going to jail for something that he did not do. Mr Brown was then conveyed to a custody suite at Heathrow airport where his detention was authorised.
