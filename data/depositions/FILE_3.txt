Right okay. To make sure I'm doing my job okay. Yeah all right. All right so amm if that comes on just to make you aware but just 
forget about it. So and we're in Musgrave ah Police Station, it's Thursday the 31st of January and the time on the interview room clock is 2219. I am interviewing, just for the tape if you just give me your full name, date of birth. 
It's eh Mr Roberts Spiers amm twent, nine, 20th of the 1 s t 1983. Cheers Robert thank you and you have your Solicitor with you. Andrew Russell. And you've had a chance to speak with Mr Russell. I have indeed. And you understand thal al any slaye during this process if you 
need to speak to Mr Russell again, just make us aware and we'll, we'll facilitate that for you. 
Right okay. All right no problem. I'm Detective Constable Gill Whitla., I'm currently attached to the Serious Crime Branch in amm Ladas Drive and my colleague.

Okay so you were arrested earlier this evening by Detective Constable amm O'Donnell I think it was, his very precise notes that thirteen minutes past seven amm and you were arrested for the offence of murder and ah Detective Constable O'Donnell would have cautioned you at that time. Amm so that we can ask you some questions about what's been going on over the last wee while I'm going to caution you again all right. So "You do not have to say anything but I must caution you that if you do not mention when questioned, something which you later rely on in Court it may harm your defence. If you do say anything it may be given in evidence". Now that simply means that this is your opportunity, that means I can ask you questions, it means you can choose either to answer them or not.  
SPIERS  Yeah.  
So you can talk or not talk.  
SPIERS  Yeah.  
It's up to you and I'm sure you've taken advice on that but I would impress upon you that it is your opportunity to, to talk to us and tell us what you know or tell us what, what you need to tell us because further on down the line should this matter come to court and you find yourself in a court room, then if you choose to tell the court something then that you didn't tell Detective Constable Young and myself now, the court can question that and say well whv did you not tell them that at the time.  
SPIERS  Yeah that's fine.  
Okay so you, you understand why we caution and what that caution means.  
SPIERS  Yeah.  

 Yeah okay. Right now this all is to do obviously with the murder of Mr Ian Ogle on Sunday the 2ih of January. Amm so I'm just, I'm just going to start off Robert just and I'm going to throw it out there, you're here basically because we believe, we have reason to believe that you have some knowledge or had some involvement in the murder of Mr Ogle on Sunday the 2?1h of January. So what do you know about Mr Ogle's murder.  
SOLICITOR  My client's just asked me to read eh it's a brief statement.

That's correct. And that that's clear from your statement okay. Amm I appreciate 
that you've done that and we will certainly take that on board but I still have to go through the motions of asking you some questions. No worries. And, and one thing and another, so I it's, I can't unfortunately wrap 
it up there and go that's dead on. Yeah no, no. Yeah no worries. So we have to go through the process anyway. So I I'm going to 
ask you the questions bearing in mind that you've given us that and ah as I say according to the caution it's up to you whether you answer them or not. 
Yeah no worries.

So I guess we could go towards well if that is the case, is there some way that you can tell us where you were, who you were with, is there anybody that could speak for you. Where you anywhere that we could catch you on CCTV and we could say well look if he was there he definitely wasn't anywhere near Cluan Place.

So, so you once again you know you're asking me where I was when, when you knew where I was. Well we knew where you were on the 30th but your friend had 
phoned concerned on the Monday evening, so really we're talking about 48 hours. 
Hmm. When we didn't know where you were and that was the first police got eyes on. 
Yeah. And, and established that you were actually okay, we have to do 
that, if someone goes missing and we get wind of where they are, we will go and see them and make sure, we'll satisfy ourselves. Emm hmm. That they're okay. Well they were made aware that I was quite safe at the time when 
I called and other than that I was fine. 
Ukay and you're, you're not prepared to tell us where you were for the 48 hours between you friend calling. No comment. Okay fair enough all right. Emm have you done that before is that 
out of the ordinary. 
I suppose the other part of it is, is that it's an anonymous call and so the. (Inaudible). The issue of whether it's a friend or not is. Yeah. Not available to be tested. No it's not. Well not in the information that, that we have certainly at this point.

Correct yes amm but as I say well. However police made their enquiries to try and locate you and they didn't locate you for that 48 hours so obviously to check on 
your welfare after it was recorded albeit anonymous, do you know what I mean. Have they called at Newcastle Street in that. I believe they maybe. In the between period. Called at your home address that was in the system. Well. I'm not sure if they called at Newcastle Street. Well in fairness you know I, every morning I would go to my own 
house every morning to check for mail and you know the night prior to the two girls calling to the house. Emm hmm. Well there was no call, calling card to say you know give us ring. 

Right. And even, even you know and whenever they called I was there I was, I was. 
At the Newcastle Street. Yeah. But had you. I was in bed. Stayed in your own address any of the nights from Sunday night. No comment. I suppose like, like it's emm anyway my client has, has said there 

that there wasn't issue and that he was where he was and that, that, that it wasn't a matter of concern for him.

SPIERS No comment. 
Anything there. 
We know that car's black because obviously it's, it's, it's been registered as a black Seat Leon but obviously people would describe that some then some other people would describe it as a dark coloured Seat Leon and I apprec, appreciate under the sodium lights there's a little bit of a difference in colouring. So that is lit up, illuminated because of obviously the police lights on it and the tent, forensic tent over it keeping it, keeping it clean and dry. Have you ever seen that in the area. 
SPIERS No comment. 
I suppose following from that, were you in any dark coloured Seat Leons on Sunday or Monday evening. 
SPIERS No comment. 
Or do you know any of your mates or associates have a dark coloured Leon. 
SPIERS No comment. 
This is eh front lnte:-icr of the vehicle. Emm so again it looks like a Yankee candle eh air freshener hanging down with the GO one emm and in the centre beside the gearstick, behind the gearstick near the buckles there's what appears to be grey gloves. 
Take your time and take a look at it. 
SPIERS Right. 
Do you recognise firstly this interior of this vehicle. 
SPIERS No comment. 
But that I mean there's probably not too many have both of those maybe one or other but emm a Yankee candle, white Yankee candle air freshener and a GO air freshener both hanging. What about the gloves.

Emm again Robert then this is a continuation of the previous interviews. Emm the last interview terminated at 1616. Emm you're here following your arrest on suspicion of murder of Ian Ogle. I'll just caution you, "You do not have to say anything but I must caution you that if you do not mention when questioned,something that you later rely on in Court it may harm yourdefence. If you do say anything it may be given in evidence". You understand the caution, emm so like I say we finished off the last interview emm 1616 and we wme chatting ahout Amm Semi Chem top-up on the phones. We're going to move on in this interview emm and we have a map here we're going to just go through with you okay, the map of the area in which the murder took place and emm in relation to the vehicle, the black Leon that was used emm to transport the suspect. 
Right okay, there's a view marked from this ah map, I'm going to mark this amm AM1 and that's just the designated, amm basically,I'm going to stand up if you don't mind. This shows the, here we've got the Albertbridge Road all right and that is Templemore Avenue that way and that's the New1ownards Road okay. Now the assault took place at Cluan Place okay the IP lives at number 4 that's Ian's house and the assault took place in, in there and what's happened is they've done little marks here and this is basically to show which way and this is from people who have come forward to give statements, say that the attackers were on foot running and ran up down Templemore Avenue and got into the car which was the black Leon, Seat and that the car headed off with two on it, in it and ran and drove off towards the Newtownards Road.

because you were involved in this. I've no involvement in nothing, involved in nothing. And you said most people know that you'd be at Newcastle Street

No I said till them was that essential and they says well not really because they don't cover the cost of break, breakage of glass, so you know it's the simple scenario of you know either pay for it yourself or we come to some kinda agreement plan of 20 pound a month and I says well obviously well it'll have to be resolved like but you know what I mean so I didn't go, I'm obviously I'm at my house every day checking up on it know what I mean. 
Okay and has anything like that happened before you windows getting putting in or anything. 
Well this is, this is, this is, this is what was a bit confusing to me I've never had no bother with nobody you know what I mean I keep myself to myself. 
Could this be as a back lash of your involvement in the murder of Mr Ogle. 
Here we go I'm not I haven't been involved in nothing. 
Have you never had any bother before and then an anonymous caller's concerned for your safety and then your windows are put in. 
My client's already I suppose he's already, we don't know who the anonymous caller is and, and the other purposes if someone would be concerned for your safety it begs a questions why, why remain anonymous. Emm but he has said that there was nothing in, in that. 
Just this is the first we're hearing about the windows too and you're saying you'd no bother ever before. 
Aye cause I only found, I only .... 
In a couple of years living there and then the week that this happens somebody puts your windows.

Now there's bits of them which amm are irrelevant they're talking about what they did at tea time and how they managed to be in that area which is, we could be here to Christmas reading that. 
SOLICITOR Just not dwell on it. 
Okay, okay. 
Emm also bear with me with the writing ah of some of them so this is emm from a pastor who emm says, on Sunday the 2th of January 2019 at approximately 9 pm he was emm on the Albertbridge Road emm he says emm he contacted the police on '999'. He left one of the congregation emm round to her car as it 
( was dark emm didn't want her to walk alone emm she, she was parked in the car park behind the church, the entrance to which is from Cluan Place which turning right out of our front door is the first turn on the right. 
Yeah (inaudible) down in there. 
Cheers. 
There. 
So just as we entered Cluan Place I met l<Jn Ogle 'Oggie'. stopped, shook his hand and spoke to him and the emm personwho was walkino to thA car just went 00 to her i::ar. Emm so he then says he stood chatting with Ian Ogle emrn at that junction of Qu, Cluan Place with the Albertbridge Road, the junction of the Albertbridge and Cluan. Eh we spoke for a good 10 minutes or so eh he was in an agitated state, not out of control but I know there had been some sort of altercation involving his son or daughterwith a local group with the UVF. Ian didn't mention them by name but I have always suspected that was the group he was havingdifficulties with. There has been a number of incidents going back to 2017. Someone in a car tried to run him over, a number of shouting matches on the streets. Ian was, Ian was UVF himself but he considered himself old school. He disagreed with drugs, he told, he told me so before he was anti then. This may have been a cause of the fall out, this was the impression I got from him that it may have led to he and his family falling out with them. I forgetthe precise words he used but he was standing out concerned because there had been an incident with either his son or daughter this evening about 10 minutes before we met, I think he was trying to protect his family. I think he may have said they're on their way. We also spoke about God, Ian wasn't part of our congregation but I have known him for a number of years eh they were welcoming to their home. Emm just bear with me some of this is just opinion. I held his hand and we prayed together on the

street and I prayed to God to protect him. They were then joined by another male that emm the pastor didn't know. I then became aware of a group of about 5 people, they all had hoods and scarfs up except one, except one who had a partial beard. His face was exposed, he had short hair, I believe his hair was brown, his beard was perhaps 5 days stubble and he had side burns, they were, they were coming from Templemore Road direction these 5 people. Emm when they passed the beginning of the church building I thought they were teenagers and covered up as teenagers sometimes would but as they passed by our front door I realised something more sinister was happening, they were walking with purpose. As they passed the, the post box about 15 yards from me, I thought they looked very menacing. I think he knew what was about to happen as they started to move more, now more rapidly towards him, he moved towards them. They came into contact together at the pavement on this side of Cluan Place, the pavement nearer to our building. I can only describe the men as wearing dark scarfs well up over their faces between their hoods covering up their faces and scarfs up over the bridgeof their noses, you couldn't see their faces. The man with the beard looked older, I got the impression he was in-charge. I don't know why I think he was in-charge but I did feel that he kept his gaze firmly on what they were doing. Initially I thought it was a punishment beating. They were like a pack of hyenas, they laid into him, they were spread around him. His arms seemed to be held out to the side to disable his arms, he couldn't protect himself. They were punching and kicking him, his head was down. there was movement from where it started to the middle of the road, the blows still coming down on him. I saw a bat of some description, it looked like a baseball bat. They were hitting him at the back and he went down. They continued to attack him and then they started to walk away. The smallest one in the grey hoodie stamped on Ian's head as well as kicking. He stamped on his head 4 or 5 times. He then says he shouted at the group, he said that's enough stop, don't stamp on his head anymore, don't stamp on his head or words to that effect. He did, he did then stop. He didn't look at me just walked briskly off the others. I didn't notice what direction the attackers went. He went over to him then emm he was groaning a low growl, he wasn't breathing. I thought he was lying as if in the recovery position. I worried if his neck was broken having been stamped on. I lay my hands on his belly and prayed. He let out a couple of groans. His son Ryan arrived emm he was distressed at the sight of his dad. Ryan was trying to get a response from his dad and was talking to him. He was bleeding,there was a pool of blood beside him but not a heavy flow from anywhere, there seemed to be a number of puncture wounds. Emm he says he doesn't know if the bat had nails or something emm and he says he knows that someone mentioned seeing a blade but he didn't see any. Emm he then says he noticed emm

Ian's eyes half open and glazed, I thought he was gone but hoped he was just knocked out. Emm the ambulance then came emm his family were around and were all hysterical, it's a terrible scene. As I said I didn't see where the gang went to but I believe they went back in the direction from which they came. Do you have anything to say about that statement Robert. 
Other than it sounds a bit horrific like but to be honest with you but I don't, I don't, don't know nothing about it as I've said to be honest.

us on the opposite side of Templemore Avenue, He was walking quickly but not running. I was not able to make out his face and I heard him talking loudly to somebody coming behind him. I looked round to see who he was talking to. I then saw il second male in all, also in dark clothing with a scarf covering his face above his nose but below his eyes and had his hood up .. The face covering was also dark coloured. This male was around the same height as the first male and of similar build. I could also see this second male was carrying a large knife with a blade ofaround 8 inches long, silver coloured, it was reflecting the light in the street as he walked. The knife had a curved edge and a black handle. The male was carrying the knife in his right hand down by his side and I said you kn.ow look at the length of that knife, size referring to it. I then saw some more men coming along behind the second male who had the knife, along Templemore Avenue. I cannot remember how many or anything about these men, however it seemed that �all these men knew each other and they were talking. 
,,-' . 
The group of men then talked to a second male with the knife but I can't recall what they said. I saw the group of'men get into the black car down a (inaudible) a black the black car. The car looked like ii was fairly newish, a good car and it was parked off Templemore Avenue in one of the side streets opposite amm. 
Excuse me. 
I didn't notice anything about the car and it drove away from where I was. I can't recall the registration. The first two males continued walkinq along Templemore Avenue, thnt would he thP 5 font 9 male at the start and the one with the knife. Emm but I don't know where they went. I would estimate all the males were in, age aged in and around their late teens to early twenties. These males were only in my view for several minutes and in my view from across Templemore Avenue was unrestricted. Okay. Robert is there anything you want to say about that. 
Nothfng at all love to be honest. 
Okay. What could you tell me what height you are.

It can be quite subjective in a build anyway this, this, this witness describes as medium build. She describes the first two as medium build and about approximately 5 foot 9. The second one had the, the large knife, was that you, were you carrying the knife.

Was either of those people you. No comment. 
Okay. They go to describe that the other men following behind all new each other, they were talking to each other. Were you one of that group of men walking down Templemore Avenue that evening.

Do you own a tracksuit that had a pale coloured broad stripe down one leg. Not that I'm aware of. Or a tracksuit pale grey tracksuit. What about it. Do you have one of those. I can't think I don't think so no. Apart from the one that you have now but. Well apart from this one aye, that's cracker isn't it. It's a real, this tracksuit would be one that you wear outside with a 
hood on it. Do you have one of those. I don't know I don't think so. Okay. Is there anything you want to say about that. Then just in relation to the knife it's a fairly good description, 
8 inch. That's right. Blade, do you have a knife that's black handled and a eight in.

Okay this is emm another statement from a member of the public that was in the area emm standing outside eh on the 2?1h Januarystanding outside Templemore swim centre again as my colleague had shown you on Templemore Avenue emm it was around 9.20 pm eh she said the, as I was standing outside I remember it was cold and yet dry. We were standing outside for just around 2 to 3 minutes chatting and I noticed persons on the opposite side of the road and coming from the Albertbridge direction. The person,persons when I first seen them were passing the houses next to Keens shop. Do you know where the swimming pool is. 
No comment. 
On Alb, is the emm Templemore Avenue. 
Emm hmm. 
Do you know where Keens shop what's called Keens shop by locals. 
No comment. 
That's it, that's it there that's the corner with the big shop just on the corner of the Albertb'ridge Road and the Templemore Avenue you can't miss it it's about 7 or 8 windows with furniture in it. 
These persons really took my attention. I seen that they were wearing balaclavas. Emm the person I believe were men emm they appeared to be young and fast on their feet. They were making noise emm saying something but I couldn't tell what, they were communicating with each other emm but I can't, can't saywhat. They passed us and never looked in our direction at anypoint. They ran right passed us on the other side and down the street to the left after. Eh I know that this is called Madrid Street and I think my colleague had pointed out Madrid Street earlier as here. 
Yeah. 
So this is one of the witnesses. 
{Inaudible). 
That has stated that they observed the males after they'd attacked Mr Ogle going along, up here and along Madrid Street. Emm when I first noticed them until they went into Madrid Street I would say this took around 30 seconds in total and she didn't rec, she didn't recognise any of the people. Emm she says they were all about the same height and build, none of them stood out as very

different height or build. Emm they were all appeared to be average height and slim were of slim build. So the first had a balaclava with two separate holes for the eyes and none for the mouth. The balaclava was black, dark coloured. He had long sleeve top on that's all I can say. The second also wore a balaclava the same as the first. This man had a knife in his hand. The knife handle was in his hand and the blade was backwards, sort of up his arm as if holding the knife upside down or the wrong way. This man was wearing track bottoms that appeared to have cuffs at the bottom. The other two wore what appeared to be scarves. They appeared to be lighter in colour, not black and I think they all ha, had their hoods up. They all ran, ran in single file and were wearing trainers. She goes on to say emm when they left, when the males left her line of sight her attention went to a car that was parked directly opposite ah directly across from her. Emm she says she thinks that believes that it's called Langtree Court. 
That's it there that's where the car was parked the black car was parked in Langtree Court. 
The car was parked on the right hand side of the road, all four doors of the car opened and they piled in. All doors closed again and the car drove up I think it says Langtree Court and turned. 
Emm hmm it's a dead end. 
I think this is a dead end, I think Langtree Court is a dead end. 
Yeah. 
But then eh turned left onto Templemore Avenue and drove down the street before taking the second turn on the right. Emm so she said so she says it went in the direction of Templemore Avenue and, and then, then took the second turn on the right and she said that the car ernm was fairly new ernm and was a dark, was a black Seat Leon, so that's the vehicle we've been talking about. Emm and she, she took the registration down and passed it to police. She said the number plate was clearly visible as you seen from the photos earlier. The only thing I can say about the occupants of the car was that one of the person had a lighter top on than, than the rest. I would say he got into the driver's side of the car. Is there anything Robert you want to say about that particular statement. 
Nothing at all. 
Were you wearing a balaclava on Sunday night.

would be heading back towards the city and eh just they had crossed the light, the lights changed amm so two males crossing the road about 20 yards in front of me. They were close enough for me to feel like I needed to slow down and it must have been about 9.25 or 9.30. I recall that they were running and kept looking over the back of their shoulder and this drew my attention to them. Both, both the males were together and I remember thinking they must have been up� to something cause they kept looking around to see who was at, behind them. Amm I looked up left to see which street they were coming from but I couldn't see the actual street sign as it was quite dark. Amm I think they came from in around Tower Street or Westburn, I think it's Westbourne Street and that would be just Tower Street's there, Westbourne's just in there and down there. Do you know that area, do you know where Tower Street is, it's down beside the, the Institute College of Technology, I think it's, it's used to be the old Rupert Stanley but now it's the Belfast Institute, do you know there. 
No comment. 
Okay. She says that ah they were they had come from there and they were heading the direction of the walkway beside the play park. Now the walkway beside the play park is over here and bearing in mind that the black Leon car was in Pitt Place and people cross over and walk that is the, the amm play park area there okay. Both male males were similar shape in size and I would descrihe thAm 8s possibly appro:-'.imate!y 17, 1 G years based on their skinny build and average height of about 5 foot 10. They were both white and wearing similar style clothing. One of the males was wearing what I would describe as a dark grey waterproof jacket that had bits of reflected marking on it. It went on to just below waist length. I think he was wearing track bottoms like joggers which were dark in colour. I didn't notice his footwear or so and I presume ii was dark. This male had his hood up and I noticed the peak of a hat underneath. I believe it was also dark. The other male wasn't wearing a hat but again he too had his hood up. I don't believe he was wearing a coat just a dark coloured hoodie. His bottoms were basically the same as the others. I would say dark colour and I but I don't necessarily mean black, it could be grey or very dark grey. The male seemed very uneasy and I observed the males which would have been about a total of 5 seconds and it was mostly from behind where I was looking at them, trying to see what they were at and where they were, what roads they going to. When I saw them I was very close to them and there was nothing between us. She says that I couldn't give you any facial fig ah figures but the males had been wearing a scarf or snood but definitely not a mask or a balaclava and there was nobody else in the street. Do you recognise the description of any of those.

remarks until they got home and then later on heard the news and thought my goodness they might have something to do with it and that's how they've come to our attention. So basically this is again just the fact that the two fellas had run down, come off into Tower Street and across into the play park which you can get back onto the path into the houses into the area.

you running up Frome Street towards Wye Street. 
I respect that Constable you know what I mean that's totally your opinion but you know I've nothing to say in regards to the matter. Ok, because you've got a phone call from Johnny Brown. Well this is what you're allegedly thinking then, that's your opinion

Ok. As I said then you were arrested on the 31st of January em ok and your house was searched ok. We'll just touch on, sorry eh the post mortem findings ok in relation to Ian Ogle's murder ok.

So this is the post mortem findings, eh the post mortem was carried out by Doctor Peter Ingram ok. He talks about the fractured skull ok and any marks, eh but then he moves onto the stab wounds ok. There are two stab wounds to the back  
right hand shoulder, one is minor and possibly caused by the tip of a knife. Ok but there are further nine stab injuries on the back. One of the wounds entered the left chest cavity and damaged the aorta. This was the fatal injury and even if it occurred in an A & E department it would not have been survivable. The other stab wounds did not enter the chest cavity. Ok, he then went on to saythe fatal wound was most likely caused by a knife with a boat sh2ped b!2de.  
SOLICITOR  What sorry.  
Sorry boat shaped blade around 14 centimetres in length. This is an approxim, approximisation.

Or the product code ok and as I've said throughout this is a large police investigation and enquiries are then carried out in relation to these knives ok and I'll refer back to the photograph DT5 ok. Eh the product code then is eh yeah 2. 
2. 
90435 ok and police quickly identified that that was purchased in the Lidl, Lidl shop ok and in fact eh exhibit EF36 is the full set ok. The full set of knives ok. 

Eh EF, EF36 is a picture of a full set of knives purchased from Lidl. 
Yes. 
And what is the product code on those. 
Eh it would be this here. 
290435. 
So it's not specific to a particular set it's generic to the entire range. 
Yeah to the range. 
To, to the batch yes. 
It's not an individual set ok. 
Ok thank you. 
But it is a set ok. Eh it includes eh the sharpener ok, a knife, the same knife seized from your house HK1 at the time of your arrest on the 31 s t and the subsequent knives eh seized eh in the follow.up search on the 18th of March but significantly the one missing is the murder weapon in this case ok found in the Connswater on the 14th of January or 14th of February this year Robert, so how did that knife get there.

the one found in the river. Well would I not be right in saying and fair in saying you know that in regards to these things anything never mind a knife it's, it's a m, it's a moveable object so you know is there not a possibility you 
know where somebody that could have been in my house at anystage could have possibly removed this. Yes and we've asked you to account for that. And I'm giving you the, the response to that you know what I

out all the time. Know what I mean. And I've asked you several times who has access to your house. Well if I'm partying you know and on which I have done on 
occasions. How long have you been in that house for. About four years. Four years and is it private rented or what Housing Executive. What rel, what relevance does that make. It helps us to narrow down who has access to your house. Do 
you've a landlord, a private landlord that would come to your house.

So when this set came to your house obviously it was a full set, it comes packaged up like a whole set. 
I don't know whether it was a full set or not or whether they were bought individually or what (inaudible). 
That's why I'm giving you the opportunity to tell us. 
I've no idea, I can't, I can't answer that question. 
Well I can tell you that they come in a full set like this, obviously packaged, there're not individual you know they're, they're wrapped up and the, the five knives and the, the sharpener are there. 
Well in my defence you know I can't comment on it, you know as I've said I've had several girls living with me, I've had people coming in and out of the house buying me gifts, I can't determine whether they were, they were give to me as a set or whether they were brought in individually or where they came from I just can't recall it. 
Ok but we can confirm that they were found in your house during searches. 
(inaudible). 
And the one missing, it was this one here that was found in the Connswater River. 
So what do you want me to say. 
No I'm, no I'm just, I'm just saying that's, that is the case, you know you're saying you can't confirm but I said I can confirm that they were found. 
Aye well if that there's what you're saying yes. 
In your house during searches of your property. 
That doesn't necessarily mean to say that it has anything to do with me does it. 
No I'm just, I'm just telling you, you know you're saying how do you know and I'm explaining that they were found in your house.

that's whatever your analysis on it is is totally up to you.

bought me gifts you know I don't know eh I've had several girlfriends over the, the, the years you know what I mean, you know there's, there's multiple solutions or conclusions as to what the craic could be.

Can I just em enquire further about there's 48 of these sets in the Connswater sold, do you know how many were sold from Lidl in Belfast or in general (inaudible). 
Em I do, I do have the numbers, there was eh I don't think. How many batches were sold. Yeah they were all sold in and around the time so 48 units in the 
Belfast one, em then let's see if I noted the other ones down here. I don't, I have the figures there, roughly em the Castlereagh Road I think just going by had about 18, the ones in Montgomery Road about 18 units, eh Newtownabbey had something similar eh about 40 units and then there was another Belfast High Street I think had 30 units. They're just rough approximations. 
That's ok. But that's, that's sort of the numbers. So it's well, well over a 100 sets. Yeah, mm hmm. Ok and that's and you don't know whether or not this Ernesto set 
is sold by Lidl exclusively or do you know that. It's also sold em on Amazon. Right, ok. Thank you. But as I said nothing forensically found on the knife due to the time 
in the river em but as with other things eh as part of forensics things change and that may change in time ok. 
Yeah that's fine, that's no worries. Ok and that's why we're giving you this time to account for why that knife may be missing from your house. 
Yeah. Ok and this knife is one part of the investigation, one part of the 
case against you Robert ok and I'm going to go through some of the, the facts. Yeah that's fine, no worries. If that's what you think.

Against yourself, so you think of this knife as part of it ok. So you're arrested on the 31 st of January this year and you've been interviewed several times by police, ok Robert. Em throughout the interview process eh we've shown you the following evidence which links you to this murder and together eh it is not just circumstantial evidence ok. A phone number eh put to you eh believed to be used by yourself Robert Spiers, the number 07928202502 is in contact with Johnathan Brown charged with this murder immediately after the assault on Neil Ogle and before the subsequent murder of Ian Ogle between the times eh 8.46pm and 21.04pm ok. Phone records also show no outgoing activity on the phone we put to yourself Robert eh between the hours 
21 :02:29 and 21 :52:39. Eh this phone remains eh in the Mersey Street mast which covers your home address ok indicating that the phone may have been left there purposely left at home ok. Is that the case did you leave your phone at home that night. 
No comment. 
Or alternatively it was at home with him. 
Eh if you can tell us that. 
Well that's, you're making the assumption it was left at home as if he'd left and there's no evidence he'd left. 
Mm hmm b11t he h,isn't tnld Ll!'S he w,is ,it hnme 
So I'm just, I'm just, he doesn't have to confirm anything. 
(inaudible). 
Doesn't prove that he'd left the house at all the fact that his phone was in the Mersey Street mast, anyway that's for a different day. 
During eh your previous interviews then you denied you had a mobile phone eh but a phone number linked to Spiersy which we discussed in other people's contact, eh was contacted by Johnathan Brown prior to the murder and twice afterwards and was topped up at the Semi Chem Connswater on the ?1h of January this year. Ok, so we'd say, we would say you have a mobile phone Robert. CCTV evidence shows that at 2108 a male wearing clothes similar to those worn by the male carrying a knife observed on CCTV at the Glider bus shelter, runs down Frame Street/Wye Street and from the direction of Spier your home, only a few minutes walk away. We'd say that's you going to eh Wye Street. CCTV then shows a car similar to the Seat Leon driving away from the direction of 14 Wye Street at 2109 hours and this

car is believed to have been driven by Johnathan Brown and carrying yourself and others Robert. CCTV evidence shows a male to be eh yourself Robert walking in a group of five males towards Cluan Place before the attack and returning afterwards and you're believed to be the knife man in the green jacket. A knife and a baton were then recovered from the Connswater River adjacent to Mersey Street bridge, a short distance from your home and the Pathologist has stated that the recovered knife is consistent with the knife used to stab Ian Ogle and the knife is identified as from an Ernesto set of knives, a set of 7 including five knives and during a search at your eh address Robert, eh 20 Mersey Street, an Ernesto set of knives was located and this set had two items missing. One was seized by police during a search on the 19th of March eh this year and the other matches the knife recovered from the Connswater ok the Ernesto set em 290435 ok and this is consistent with the knife used to murder Ian Ogle. Ok Robert. Do you understand then why you're here today, why you have been initially arrested and bailed today. We would say that that's you in the CCTV, phone records would indicate you're contacted by Johnathan Brown. 
Well as I, as I've said to you before you know what you think and, and what, what is, is, is two different things. I've not, no comment to make to you Detective. 
That you were contacted by Johnathan Brown to go to Mark SewAll's housP. 
Was I, is that what, is you, you saying that that's what happened. 
Yeah that's what I'm saying. Uh huh. 
Well what you say and what actually was the case which I'm not aware of is two different things isn't it. 
Well what, what did he say to you in the conversation then when he rang you. 
He didn't say nothing cause I didn't have a conversation with anyone. I've no comment to make on it. 
Well I believe he contacted you for a 37 second phone call.

Why have I moved because my car was vandalised several weeks ago, my hou, my windows in my house has been smashed continuously over and over again, then also in the process of that up until I just can't remember what date it was, I think it was one day last week em a couple of alleged people tried to enter mypremises and you know what their intentions were whether to tryattack, kill me or whatever I don't know but once again that there's another ongoing situation in my case at the moment which is still ongoing an,ct that and it was the Housing Executive that had advised me that it would be best for me to move out because you know they didn't want me being in danger or you know the other neighbours.

I wasn't present, I didn't do your original interviews ok so I'm gonna go through them here ok. Ah and they're images captured from CCTV ah CS12 ok and this is the topping up of a mobile phone number 07928202502 ok. Do you wish to tell us about that number at this stage Robert.

Ok at the time of those interviews on the 31 st of January ah you denied that you had a mobile phone, is that still correct. 
SPIERS No comment. 
Or did you have a mobile phone.

And you're entitled to your no comment stance ok. 
SPIERS I've nothing further to say till you to be honest. 
Ok, that as I'm saying to you we've now spoken to a ex partner and got an image there of yourself in this coat ok because we say that that number 502 is involved in the murder and we would say that that is your number ok. 
SPIERS That's your opinion.

SPIERS Yes what I've said and I'm only. 
Ok.

I've nothing to tell you at love to be honest. Ok there's only 2 rooms in the house so bedrooms so ahm we took this to be yours and this is where the blue coat was found and you can't see but there is a big furry collar on it as well so to my mind looking at these images which we had at the search

The vehicle we believe involved in em getting the some of the five persons there to, to attack Ian was seen on Templemore Avenue em and it was a black Seat Leon em and then the offenders then left in that vehicle as well and headed off I believe in the direction of Major Street onto the Newtownards Road.

I know that's something you're just putting to him but obviously you haven't presented any evidence which connects him to the offence as well. 
Ok well it's information received and it's police belief that you are one of the five persons who brutally attacked Ian with not only knives but batons and physical assault as well. Eh, eh I mean his head he was jumped on I believe ten to twenty times on the head as well and body em so I mean I, Ian was, the people who went to attack him intended to murder him there was no way he was walking away from that.

Ok. Eh I propose to go through a couple of statements here eh initially em the first one I'm going to read out to you and I'll just read selective bits to you I'm not going to read the whole thing out just the sort of most relevant parts em to yourself eh and it's from the Pastor that was with Ian when he was attacked ok. So the Pastor would say on Sunday the 2ih of January 2019 at approximately 9pm em he was in Cluan Place with Ian Ogle ok. Em just as he entered Cluan Place eh that's where he met Ian Ogle and he said his nickname is Ogie: I stopped, shook his hand and spoke to him em and we stood chatting in the mouth of the junction of Cluan Place eh with the albert, junction with the Albertbridge Road and they were chatting for about ten minutes or so. Ai that point he would say that Ian was in an agitated state not, he he described him as not being out of control em but he knows that there had been some kind of altercation involving Ian's son or daughter em with what he believed was the UVF eh which I would interpret that to be the the assault on Neil Ogle earlier that evening by Ryan, Ian's son. 
SOLICITOR Is that eh how would he have known that. How cause if he says the daughter is there not a son and daughter. 
Well this is what, he's having a conversation with Ian Ogle. 
ERVINE Yeah. 
Immediately after this attack on on you know assault on Neil Ogle. 
SOLICITOR Yeah. 
So yes the Pastor has hasn't picked it up possibly fully em but he he he knows that. 
SOLICITOR Yeah. 
He knows that it was Ian's son or daughter and him that were involved in in an altercation, I'm going to assume it's the one that we believe is linked and may be the motivation behind the murder on Ian ok, if you want to tell me different then that's up to you. Em and he would say that the altercation em was with a local group but the the the UVF he believes although he says Ian didn't mention them by name em but he says I've always suspected that was the

group he was having difficulties with and that there'd been a number of incidents going back to 2017 so it was not just that that incident that night but there's been, there's a background and a history there ok so that's the first mention of the UVF in the inteiview process. Are you a member of the UVF. 
No comment. 
Did the UVF carry out this murder. 
No comment. 
Do you know of a feud with Ian Ogle and other members of the UVF. 
No comment. 
Because the Pastor would go on to say that em he believed that Ian was previously a member of the UVF himself eh but he was more old school and disagreed with drugs em and that sort of thing so it sounds like you know there's a difference of opinion with Ian and other members, wa was was the drugs the the reason Ian was murdered. 
No comment. 
Do any, are any of those other boys that I mentioned before Jonathan Brown, Mark Sewell eh Reece Kirkwood, Nathan Hands. 
Jonathan Brown. 
Jonathan Brown and Christopher Haire any of those guys members of the UVF. 
No comment. 
Or was it somebody within the UVF had tasked yous to go and do this and you might not be members necessarily but you were tasked by the UVF to go and carry out this murder.

Ok. He says now that that Ian was very anti them at that point em and that was the impression that he got from him. And it may have led to he and his family falling out with them, obviously Nell Ogle, Ian Ogle there's there's some relationship there I believe they may be cousins, did you know that. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Do you know why they'd fallen out. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Ok. Em and just to clarify on the point your solicitor raised there em he does go on to say again he talks about there had been an incident with either his son or daughter this evening about ten minutes before we met so he's, he believed he was there in Cluan Place in order to protect his family and that's why he was standing out in the street as opposed to be in his house. Any knowledge of that. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Ian told the Pastor that he was expecting trouble and he, I think he may have said they're on their way and he said he'rl oot c1 sAnse of impAnrlino doom At thc1t point lhP)' they started to talk about God em and they start to pray so Ian Ian seems to be aware of the fact that somebody's coming for him that night. Why would Ian have thought that. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Did you pass the message on that Ian Ogle or any member of his family that anyone was coming after him. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Do you know of anybody passing on that message. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Or making threats towards Ian.

Because of what had just happened. 
No comment. 
So he goes on to talk about the five people and this is what, why we believe there's five five main persons involved in the attack em and he says I then became aware of a group of about people, they all had hea hoods and scarves up except one who had a partial beard, his face was exposed, he had short hair em I believe his hair was brown em the beard was perhaps five days stubble, he had sideburns, they were coming from the Templemore Road direction. Are you one of these people he's talking about. 
No comment. 
And again that Templemore Road reference would tie in with where the vehicle was parked up in Templemcire Avenue in Langtry Court just off Templemore Avenue. So it would indicate the vehicle's parked and that the persons in the car have got out and walke_d down to meet Ian in Cluan Place. Was that done by arrangement. 
No comment. 
The Pastor talks about the guy with the partial beard. I see you today are relatively clean shaven have you had a beard, have you, did you have a beard on Sunday the 2ylh _

Have you shaved it off since then.

Does he say that he recognises that person or anything. He doesn't. At that point he realises something more sinister was happening and that they were walking with purpose. A as they passed the post box about fifteen yards from me I thought they looked very menacing. Ian turned around and I think he knew what was about to happen. So Ian's expecting this he's expecting people to land down at his house or to come looking for either him or his his son we believe. Did you go either after him or Ryan and that because Ian's out in the street he's the one that gets it and 
Ryan doesn't get touched because he's he's not with him. Was the orders to go and get Ian and Ryan. No comment. Did you give the orders. No comment. Was it a case that yous were going to get Ryan and Ian 
was there. No comment. And you got him instead. No comment. He describes the men as wearing dark scarves well up 
over their faces and the smaller one among them was wearing a grey hoodie. What were you wearing that night. No comment. Did you have a scarf round your face. No comment. Who was wearing a grey hoodie. No comment. Was that you.

No comment. 
Where are those clothes now. 
No. 
And those scarves. 
No comment. 
He talks again about the man with the beard who looked older and he got the impression that he was in charge he says he doesn't know why he thinks that but he he kept his gaze firmly on what they were doing and that this male never looked in my direction. Who was in charge. 
No comment. 
Is it somebody different than we've, than any of those we've mentioned before. 
No comment. 
He thought initially it was it was a punishment beating and that they were like a pack of hyenas and they laid into him, they were spread around him, his arms seemed to be held out to the side em as if to disable his arms and he couldn't protect himself, they were punching and kicking his head, him and his head was down. So it's a it's a sustained attack em as he describes like a pack of hyenas all laying in to a defenceless person on their own. Five against one it's never going to be a fair fight and then there's weapons introduced as well so like I said before Ian Ian was never walking out of this and the fact that there was knives brought to this would indicate that it was pre-mediated murder and that had been the plan to go and murder Ian and stab him. Is that the case. 
No comment. 
At one point he notices that when the blows are still raining down, still coming down on him I saw a bat of some description it looked like a baseball bat, it it seemed burgundy in colour or a dark colour maybe even purple or brown and they were hitting, hitting him at the back and he

No comment. Cause again the the Pastor doesn't actually mention the knife and obv obviously we know Ian has been, he was stabbed em and had numerous stab wounds so it may even be at this this, what he's describing as a bat could be the handle of c1 kn the knife even. Is thFJt the r.c1se. 
No comment. Were you holding a knife. No comment. He says the smallest one in the grey hoodie stamped on 
Ian's head as well as kicking him and he stamped on his head four to five times. Was that you did that. No comment. What height would you be. No comment. Would you be smaller than the other guys. No comment. 8

Who stamped on his head. No comment. At that point the Pastor intervenes and says that's enough 
stop don't stand on his head anymore or words to that effect and the guy did stop and looked him and walked away after the others who had already left at that point. Was that you he was talking to when he was telling you.

stamping on his head. No comment. Where are your trainers. No comment. And he doesn't what direc direction the attackers went in. 
What route did you take away from there. No comment. We've said previously that there was a witness eh that the

to say. No. That enough was enough. No comment. At that point Ian is lying on the ground and he wasn't 
breathing he was groaning em and he was worried, the 
Pastor was worried his neck was broken having been 
stamped on so many times. So that's the state he's been 
left in after this attack and he subsequently dies of his 
injuries at the scene. Why did yous do that to him.

No comment. Whal was the motivation for this attack. No comment. Do you have any regrets about being involved in it. No comment. Was it in the name of the UVF. No comment. Do you know they've publicly come out and and said that 
they're not involved in it I think there's been statements to the press or whatever but obviously we don't know how accurate that is. Did the UVF direct Ian's murder. 
No comment. Did you do it in their name. No comment. Are you afraid to talk to us because you're scared of what 
will happen on the outside. No comment. By members of the UVF or whoever else. No comment. It just goes on to talk about his family coming to the scene 
and the ambulance and whatever but he remembers as far as he's concerned the gang who came, the five men who came all left and went back the same way that they had, they'd come. Was the route planned. 
No comment. Or did yous make it up as went along. No comment.

Eh the persons when I first seen them were passing the houses next to Keen's shop. Do you know where that is. 
No comment. It's obviously quite local to you so you probably have a fair idea of what shop that's been referred to there. And this 
witness would describe the persons involved as wearing balaclavas. Did you have a balaclava on you that night. No comment. Did any of the other guys have a a balaclava on. No comment. The witness may be mistaken it may have simply been a 
Beanie hat or a scarf. 
Sorry Ian Davis entering the room at 1605. Just handing (lnm1rlihle) rc1per notes (inA11rlihle). Ok. Em where is that balaclava now. No comment. Where is the Beanie hat. No comment.

Templemore Avenue. Sorry which hand did she say that. She says left. But I mean if, I'm not saying this is a

No comment. Were you carrying one in your right hand. No comment. She believes that the blade was backwards up his arm as if 
holding the knife upside down and the wrong way and that the knife was dark in colour. Is that the way you were holding ii when you were running away.

The males were running and kept looking over their shoulders. Em the males were coming from either Tower Street or Westbourne Street, they were heading towards the walkway beside the playpark.

Well based on that and that you being the victim and you eh reporting an assault on yourself to that number em we're satisfied that that phone is attributed to you at this point ok. Em the last time that phone was used was at ten past ten on the night of the murder and it's been dead ever since. Can you give us an explanation for that. 
No comment. 
You've had that phone from at least 2017 and all of a sudden it's gone completely dead after the murder and then you disappear out of the country via Larne. It doesn't seem to me like the actions of an innocent man. Can you give any explanation at all for that. 
No comment. 
Just (inaudible) at ten past ten in and around the relevant time of the murder just before it, there's contact on your phone between yourself and two other suspects in this murder enquiry Jonathan Brown and Reece Kirkwood in and around the night of interest before the mur, before the murder and not long after it there's traces of contact between you and two other suspects in the murder. Is there anything you want to say about that all. 
No comment. 
Can you give any account of what contact or why you had contact with these two persons that night.

At the minute if you take it from our perspective we have you speaking with person suspects we believe involved in the murder having some contact with them by phone that night, the phone going dead at ten past ten, you leaving the country the next day and us subsequently receiving information that you're involved and hence way you're sitting here, I would suggest you're in a reasonab reasonably difficult scenario here em and it could be in your interest to provide us with an account if there is one em to explain what I've, what I've said to you. 
No comment. 
I say some of these males are out, are still outstanding em in terms of arrest but on their arrest are they, are they going to tell us that you were involved. 
No comment. 
And you're prepared to sit there and not tell us anything.

em and this will be applied for evidentially at a later date eh but what I'm going to go through is phone contact made, first of all from the phone that we believe is owned by yourself em and the number which I gave you earlier which was 07895 982290, again I'll just give you an opportunity to say is that your phone number. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Did you lend your phone to anybody else on that night of the 2ylh of January. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Did anyone steal your phone from you. 
ERVINE No comment. 
In your opinion have you any reason to believe that anyone else was using your phone that night. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Right. Ok well we've move on to talk about em the contact from your phone and I've told you the timings of the relevant assault at the, on Neil Ogle at Spence's Chippy again approxim;,lely ten to nine on thA 27th of .l,rn1n1;,ry ;, good half hour before Ian's murdered all right. So we're going to look at that time frame first of all eh and and just before it. 
SOLICITOR Sorry so ten to nine is when that ended thereabouts is it. 
Yeah. 
SOLICITOR The the the. 
Well I believe so, in and around that, a few minutes sort of thing but I understand that we've got ten to nine so eh if we look at your phone contact from 2002 hours, two minutes past eight on the 27th of January eh we see that your number contacts an a a number which we have yet to identify and I'm going to give you that number and ask you to tell me who ii, who ii belongs to it's 07741 899277 and there's, wait to we see there are eight different attempts to contact that number em between the hours of 2002 and 2051n.

ERVINE No comment. 
SOLICITOR 2002 to 2051h. 
ERVINE  Yeah. This is before that assault's even happened. This may not have nothing, have anything to do with it at all. Do you recognise that number. No comment.  
ERVINE  Who were you trying to get in touch with. No comment.  
Was it completely unconnected to what happens to Ian later on.  
ERVINE  No comment.  
We've asked you about Reece Kirkwood, the first time your phone makes contact or tries to make contact with Reece em is at 2025 hours on the 2yth and that's the number we have we believe to be attributable to Reece, Reece Kirkwood, 07708 424416. Why were you trying to contact Reece then.  
ERVINE  No comment.  
ERVINE  Ok then 2052 which believe the assault on Neil Ogle has just happened, again you're trying to get Reece and at that point you do get in contact with him and there's a, there's a call of two minutes and fifty-seven seconds. What were you speaking to Reece about at that time. No comment.  
ERVINE  And that could suggest that that, it's you that is is makingthe call to get the boys all gathered up to go and attack Neil or sorry Ian, is that what happened. No comment.

Was that when yous were in the car and you were going to pick him up and you were phoning that they were here now, were you. ERVINE No comment. 
2105 we have a call from your phone to Neil Ogle. What was that call about. ERVINE No comment. 
Why did you want to contact Neil Ogle. 

ERVINE No comment. 
It only lasted for two seconds your conversation you were only connected for two seconds, did you speak to him at all. 
ERVINE No comment. He's just been assaulted outside the the chippy on the Beersbridge Road and you're ringing him, what was that phone call about. 
ERVINE No comment. 
How did you know that he'd been assaulted. 
ERVINE No comment. 
( 
Or were you ringing him for an entirely different reason that had nothing to do with the with the fact he was assaulted it was pure coincidence. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Police believe that the attack on Neil Ogle has instigated this whole chain of events and that Neil has soughtretribution perhaps or someone has on his behalf to go and get revenge on Ian and Ryan if he was there potentially and here we have you contacting Neil. Is there anything you want to say about that.

So I would suggest you're contacting him because you are either putting yourself forward or you've been nominated or told that this is what you have to do this is your role and you have to go and get Ian Ogle and ,either attack him or murder him I don't know what the commands were. What were you told to do. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Was it Neil Ogle told you to do it in this conversation. 
ERVINE No comment. 
I don't have Neil's phone data here but em cause I (inaudible) due course we will have incoming and outgoing from his phone. Did he contact you first. 
ERVINE No comment. 
And this is you really phoning him back. 
ERVINE No comment. 

Or just it's only a two second call did you phone it, had he contacted you and asked you to go and do this. 
ERVINF Nn r:nmm,mt. 
To assault Ian, murder Ian and that you have just, you've phoned him back and you've agreed two seconds to say yes we're doing ii. 
ERVINE No comment. 
That's all it would take to say that. 
ERVINE No comment. 
Was ii your job to go and round up the other guys the other four involved. 
ERVINE No comment. 
And you were telling Ian it was all under control and that yous were going to take action.

The next phone call is at 21h05 and that's from your phone to Jonathan Brown who as we have said repeatedly is a key suspect in this enquiry who is currently on the run, can't be located, to be questioned in respect of it and here you are contacting him fifteen minutes before the murder takes place. What explanation can you give for that call. 
No comment. Cause it would my perception that that phone call to, these key people in the enquiry, Jonathan Brown, Neil Ogle,Reece Kirkwood, is that you were organising or were being organised to go and attack Ian and that's why you've been 
contacting them. Can you give any other explanation as to why you're contacting these people. No comment. Jonathan's number is 07493 097038. Do you recognise 
that number. No comment. That was a seven second call you had with him. What did 
you say in those seven seconds. No comment. He's likely to have been in the Seat Leon at this point em 
and driving round to collect everybody, is that what that was about. No comment. Did he tell you to bring a knife in that conversation. No comment. Did you tell him to bring a knife. No comment. Did you tell him to bring bats or batons. No comment.

We then have between 2108 and 2109 eh three attempted calls with Reece Kirkwood again. And this is just ten minutes before Ian's murdered. Again you're having contact with a relevant person to this enquiry. 
When you say attempted did none of them connect. 
They're one second each to connect. What were you trying to get in contact with Reece Kirkwood about. 
No comment. 
Again was it to plan the attack on Ian Ogle. 
No comment. 
And there doesn't seem to be any traffic on your phone for a fifteen minute period between 2109 and 2124 whereas prior to that there's been quite a lot of activity on your phone. What explanation can you give for that. 
No comment. 
Cause I would suggest that that fifteen minute period there's no traffic on your phone because that's when you're in the process of murdering Ian Ogle. What do you have say about that. 
No comment. 
You didn't need to be contacting Reece or Jonathan or Mark Sewell or whoever else was there because you were with them and you were en route to go and carry out the attack and then you did carry it out during that time, isn't that right. 
No comment. 
And the reason you aren't giving us an account for your movements that day is because you can't without implicating yourself in this murder investigation. 
No response. 
The next contact on your phone is at 2124 and again that's outgoing to Reece Kirkwood, 2124 being after the murder which happened at 2120 we believe, twenty past nine. So

No comment. Was Reece involved in the actual murder. No comment. Or were you just asking Reece to help you get rid of 
evidence afterwards. No comment. Was Reece the driver of the Seat Leon. No comment. The fact that you're ringing him would suggest you aren't

Ok we'll move on to eh information on incoming data to your phone em and at the minute what I have in front of me is in respect of Reece Kirkwood and Jonathan Brown but as I say we may have further details on your incoming traffic em in due course. So this all relates to the 2ylh of January 2019 and the first contact then is twenty, 2034 is Reece Kirkwood getting in touch with you and it's a conversation of forty-eight seconds. What was that conversation about. 
ERVINE No comment. 
At this point the assault hadn't happened on Neil Ogle so perhaps it was nothing to do with it at all. Reece tries to contact you then at 2051 on two occasions and it doesn't connect and that is the time that Neil's being assaulted so why is Reece contacting you.

(Inaudible) ok so Reece is the first person to contact you em at twenty, 2051 :59 Reece is attempting to contact you, you ring him back at 2052: 17 so he hasn't connected and you have then rang him. Neil's just been attacked what was the conversation. 
No comment. 
What was the plan. 
No comment. 
After the assault at the chip shop at 2100 hours you have three calls to your phone from Reece which all connect, for fifty-two seconds the first one, twenty-nine seconds the second one and fourteen seconds the third one. Those calls are the planning, the planning of the assault on Ian aren't they. 
No comment. 
I know you're you're obviously getting bored listening to this but you're not giving us any, you're not giving us any answers. 
No comment. 
We're putting this in front of you and you've no explanation for it. 
No comment. No comment. 
No comment because you were involved and you're involved in the planning, the organising, the carrying out of the attack on Ian and the clearing up after isn't that right.

You had further contact on your phone after the murder at 21e57 from Reece.

That's all I have, that's all I have I've nothing further I'm not trying to. Yeah. Trick you or nothing. No no, yeah. I'm just trying to say we believe Reece is involved

I, I don't understand if It's gone dead at ten past ten how does a one second call at 2246, it's my understanding (inaudible) no it's not is it. 
No it's not I can't explain that to be honest with you em perhaps it just connects eh this is incoming so maybethey're able to reach your phone maybe, 
Is that like those eh. An answer phone or something. That it just goes to. Yeah it might. Right. Em I can't say for definite but Reece Kirkwood is 
attempting to phone you at 2246, your phone had gonedead and off the networks from 221 O there's no, there's no outgoing contact from your phone after 2210 that, on that night. 
Can I just eh em if that if that one second call is eh potentially an answer machine could a two second call be just potentially an answer machine but someone just hangs up maybe a second later. 
Potentially. And could a seven second call. Potentially it can. No well well my point is can you say at all whether or not 
those calls, whether or not those calls are connected for a conversation or whether or not there's a, it's connected for a voicemail. 
From this data I have in front of me I cannot say that's. Ok. You know em. (Inaudible).

Right. 
Connected call, I believe. 
Ok. 
But at this point we, like I say we have contact with you and significant persons of interest in this enquiry suspect that we've mentioned to you throughout this interview process em you have contact with them on the night of the murder before and after and there was a fifteen period, fifteen minute period when the murder has taken place where you have no contact with any of these males. Further to that your phone goes dead at ten past ten and the next thing the next day you've disappeared and police are looking for you and information is, comes into the enquiry that you're involved in this and you're one of the five males. This is your r.h;,nr.A to givA 11<: yo11r :cir.r.ount 
No comment. 
If you played any less a role. 
No comment. 
This is your time to say ii for the court to take it, take notice of it at a later date. If you went there with the intention of merely assaulting Ian Ogle, give him a bit of a hiding for what had happened to Neil but you had no intention to murder and you may not even have had knowledge of the knife being there this is the time to tell us because the court will take notice of that information if if it can be verified, if you went there with no intention to murder that could certainly lessen sentences down down the line so it's just something for you to consider. Is there anything further you want to tell us.
