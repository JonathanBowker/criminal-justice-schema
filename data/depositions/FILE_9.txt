Introduction 



[1] I am an expert in Cell Site Analysis and Radio Frequency Surveying and have produced 
numerous reports and given evidence in court on many occasions. 
[2] I have been providing evidential products in relation to cell site and communication data for over 10 years. In the last 3 years I have been employed as a cell site and communications data expert working in the private sector and producing evidential reports and presenting evidence at court for both the prosecution and defence. 
[3] I have been fully trained in Cell Site Analysis and Radio Frequency Propagation Surveying (RFPS). I have presented cell site evidence at court in several high-profile cases. I was the North West Regional representative on the college of policing National RFPS user group. 
[4] I have been fully trained in the use of Csurv Muns!, Csurv AP, Forensic Compass Cellular and Wi-Fi specialist equipment. 
[5) I am a qualified forensic mobile phone examiner. I have been conducting forensic examinations on mobile phones for over 10 years. I hold accreditation as an examiner from Microsystemations, lnvicta Forensics, and Cellebrite Forensics. I also hold a trainer's . certificate from Cellebrite Forensics. I have also attended and passed the NPIA training courses in relation to mobile phone forensics. 
This report relates to an investigation into the murder of Ian Ogle at approximately 21:20hrs on 27 /01/19. This report aims to deal with issues surrounding the location of 3 mobile phones atlributed lo the defendants in this case. 
[7] Provide commentary on the general location of 3 mobile phones attributed to defendants in this case around the time of the offence and indicate if the phone usage is consistent with being in the vicinity of any of the identified locations at significant times.

1re of In resi 

[10] I have to the best of my knowledge and belief no connection with the defendants in this case. 
c odul y 

[11] Evidence for this report is based upon call events in the form of Call Data Records (CDRs). I have been provided with CDRs for the mobile phones attributed to the defendants in this 

investigation. 

[12] Network readings were undertaken on the 02 networks on the 9th March 2020 at the following locations: 
Pitt Place, Belfast Prince Albert Bar 356-359 Albertbridge Road, Belfast Langtry Court, Belfast. Clua n Place, Belfast. 14 Wye Street, Belfast 10 McArthur Court, Belfast 5 Newcastle Street, Belfast 
[13] An accompanying document containing Cell Site Analysis maps which are referenced in this document has also been produced. This is labelled exhibit reference: PSH2-Cell Site Analysis Maps.

[14] In this report, the terms "Mobile Station" and "handset" should be considered to have the same meaning. Furthermore, the term "call event" is used to encompass a sent/received SMS and a made/received call. 
[15] For reasons of expediency the mobile telephones considered in this analysis are referred to using the last four digits of the associated telephone numbers. These numbers are also colour-coded throughout the report as detailed in the table below. It should be noted the numbering and colour used are purely to aid the ease of identification in this report and have no further significance beyond this point. 
[16] Important note -Any reference in this report to attribution of a specific mobile telephone number to an individual is merely due to the assertions submitted by prosecution. 
077 49 8407 63  0763  02  Sewell  
07511 206614  6614  02  Rainey  
07895 982290  2290  02  Ervine  

My report and analysis has been quality checked by a suitably trained forensic expert. 
[18] The analysis and conclusions drawn in this report are based on the current evidence and information available. 
[19] If any new information or data is introduced, then the analysis and findings may change respectively. 
[20] My report is produced in accordance with Part 19 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and my duty is to neither to the prosecution or defence but rather to the court.

[21] Between 20:31:16hrs and 21:02:24hrs 0763, 2290 and 6641 are located in an area of Belfast which include the vicinities of Pitt Place, 14 Wye Street, 10 MacArthur Court and 5 Newcastle Street. 
[22] There are no recorded call events which assist in indicating the location of 0763 between 20:56:40hrs and 21:28:24hrs 
[23] Between 21:02:29hrs and 21:08:32hrs 2290 and 6614 are located in an area of Belfast which include the vicinities of Pitt Place, 14 Wye Street, 10 MacArthur Court and 5 Newcastle Street. Between 21:08:lShrs and 21:11:33hrs this area also includes Cluan Place and Langtry Court. 
[24] At a point between 21:10:07hrs and 21:24:0Shrs 2290 is located in an area of Belfast which includes the vicinities of 14 Wye Street, 5 Newcastle Street and the Prince Albert Bar. At 21:12:24hrs 6614 is also located in this area. 
[25] Between 21:12:39hrs and 21:23:34hrs 6614 is located in an area of Belfast which includes the vicinities of 14 Wye Street, 10 MacArthur Court, Cluan Place, Langtry Court and 5 Newcastle Street. 
[26] At points between 21:23:52hrs and 21:24:49hrs 2290 is located in an area of Belfast which includes the vicinities of Cluan Place and Langtry Court. 
[27] Between 21:24:49hrs and 22:53:39hrs 2290, 6614 and 0763 are located in an area of Belfast which at times includes the vicinities of Pitt Place, 14 Wye Street, 10 MacArthur Court and 5 Newcastle Street and the Prince Albert Bar. 
[28] It should be noted that in relation entries where a specific location is mentioned the phone number concerned could be located at any point within the coverage area of the cell lDs used not only at the specific location mentioned. 
[29] In this case the significant locations are very close to one another. In these circumstances it is not possible to indicate a pattern of travel from the cell lDs utilised as these cells provide coverage to multiple locations and the travel is only over short distances.

Glossary 



2G 

In mobile telephony, 2G is short for second-generation wireless telephone technology. 2G networks support encrypted voice and limited data communications. The predominant technology used in 2G networks is GSM. 2G offers additional services such as SMS. 
2,5G 

In mobile telephony, 2.SG protocols extend 2G systems to provide additional features such as packet.switched connection (GPRS) and enhanced data rates (EDGE). 
3G 

The third generation of mobile phone technologies, which builds upon 2G. 3G enables much faster connections to the Internet with enhanced multimedia experiences such as video messaging. The predominant technology used in 3G networks is UMTS. 
4G 

Fourth generation of mobile phone technologies which is based on Long Term Evolution (LTE). 4G offers even greater data rates than 3G and further enhanced services to subscribers. 
ARFCN (Absolute radio frequency channel number} 
In GSM cellular networks, an absolute radio-frequency channel number (ARFCN) is a code that specifies a pair of physical radio carriers and channels used for transmission and reception. 
Attenuation 

The decrease in the strength of a signal due to absorption and the redistribution of energy by objects 
i.e. buildings. 

Base Transceiver Station {BTS) 
Base Transceiver Stations receive and transmit signals from mobile phones. They link mobiles to the rest of the mobile and land-line network. 
BCCN (Broadcast Control Channel) 
This downlink channel contains specific parameters needed by a mobile in order that it can identify the network and gain access to it. 
BER (Bit Error Rate) 

In telecommunication transmission, the bit error rate (BER) is the percentage of bits that have errors relative to the total number of bits received in a transmission, usually expressed as ten to a negative power. For example, a transmission might have a BER of 10 to the minus 6, meaning that, out of 1,000,000 bits transmitted, one bit was in error. 

Page 25 




BS/C (Base Station Identity Code) 
Base Station Identity Code (BSIC) is a unique code contained in messages on the broadcast channels of a cell or base station that uniquely identifies the base station. 
CDMA {Code Division Muli'ip/e Access) 
CDMA is a form of multiplexing, which allows numerous signals to occupy a single transmission channel, optimizing the use of available bandwidth. 
Cellular Network 

Cellular radio is the technology that has made large scale mobile telephony possible. Current cellular networks can reuse the same radio frequencies by assigning them to cells far enough apart to reduce interference (2G). A cell is the geographical area covered by one radio base transceiver station. The size of each cell is determined by the terrain, transmission power, and forecasted number of users etc. Service coverage is achieved by an overlapping network of cells. 
Celi 

This is the physical geographical area served by a base transceiver station. Mobile networks are made up of cells which overlap each other. 
Cell ID 

A Cell ID (CID) is a generally unique number used to identify each Base transceiver station (BTS) or sector of a BTS within a Location area code (LAC) if not within a network. 
DDR data 

DDRs capture the cell details of the administrative messages (signalling) sent between the phone and the network. This messaging takes place even when the device isn't being used. It does however need to be turned on and connected to the network. The benefit of DDR data is that cell ID information is recorded in the times between calls/texts/data sessions. 
Digital In the context of mobile voice networks, voice is sampled and coded in preparation for transmission across the network. Digital networks are fast replacing analogue ones as they offer improved sound quality, secure transmission and error detection and correction. Digital networks include mobile systems and technologies such as GSM, CDMA, TOMA and UMTS. 

FDMA {Frequency Division Multiple Access) 
FDMA gives users an individual allocation of one or several frequency bands, or channels. Multiple Access systems coordinate access between multiple users. The users may further share access via additional methods such as TDMA.

GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) 
GPRS is a radio technology for GSM networks that adds packet-switching protocols, shorter set-up time for ISP connections, and offers the possibility to bill by amount of data sent rather than connect time. 
GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) 
GSM is a second-generation digital mobile cellular technology using a combination of frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TOMA). GSM is currently the most widely used digital mobile phone system and the de facto wireless telephone standard in Europe. This is the digital network that mobile phones utilise to make calls and send text messages. 
Handover 

The process used to describe the action of transferring a phone call from one base transceiver station to another as the caller moves around. 
HLR (Home location Register) 
The home location register (HLR) is a central database that contains details of each mobile phone subscriber that is authorised to use the GSM core network. The HLR stores details of every SIM card issued by the mobile phone operator. 
/MEI {International Mobile Equipment Identity) 
This is 15-digit number which identifies an individual phone to the network operators. The IMEI is only used for identifying the device and has no permanent or semi-permanent relation to the subscriber. 
IMS/ (lntema!'ional Mobile .Subscriber Identity) 
An International Mobile Subscriber Identity or IMSI is a unique identification associated with all GSM and UMTS network mobile phone users. It is stored as a 64 bit field in the SIM inside the phone and is sent by the phone to the network. It is also used for acquiring other details of the mobile in the Home Location Register (HLR) or as locally copied in the Visitor Location Register (VLR) An IMSI is usually presented as a 15 digit long number. 
LAC (location Area Code) 

The Location Area Code uniquely identifies a location area. Location areas are comprised of one or several radio cells. The LAC forms part of the Location Area Identifier (LAI) and is broadcasted on the Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH). 
MCC (Mobile Country Code) 

A three-digit identity code to denote the country of origin of the network operator 
MM.S {Multimedia Messaging Service) 
Also referred to as picture messaging, MMS works much like text messaging but with a greater capacity so you can send larger quantities of text as well as attaching images and audio files from your phone. 
Page 27 





MNC (Mobile Network Code) 
A two-digit code identifying the network operator 
MS (Mobile Station) 
The mobile station (MS) comprises all user equipment and software needed for communication with a mobile network. 
MSC {Mobile Switching Centre) 
The Mobile Switching Centre (MCS) is the primary service-delivery node for GSM and UMTS handling voice calls, SMS and other services. The MSC sets up and releases the end-to-end connection, handles mobility and hand-over requirements during the call, and takes care of charging and real-time pre.paid account monitoring. 
OS (Operating System) 
The main software that controls the basic operation of an electronic device. Windows and OSX are examples of operating systems for PCs as are Palm and Symbian for mobile devices. 
Roaming 
If you use your mobile outside your network operator's local coverage area, you are said to be 
1�roaming1 . 


HxLev (Received Signal Le vel) 
RxLEV indicates the average signal strength received. 
Service Provider 
A company that provides mobile phone users with services and subscriptions to mobile 
phone networks. 
SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) 
The SIM card is the srna1 l ca1 d inserted inside mobile phone'::>, ll idenlifies lhe user account to the network, handles authentication and provides data storage for basic user data and network information. 
SMS {Short Message Service) 
Short Message Service (SMS) are text messages of up to 160 characters to be sent and received via the network operator's message centre to a mobile handset. 
TOMA ( 
Time Division Multiple Access) 
TOMA is a digital wireless telephony transmission protocol. TOMA allocates each user a different time slot on a given frequency. 
Tri-band 

A GSM mobile of which there are two major types (European and Americas), supports three of the four major GSM frequency bands. This type of mobile handset functions in most parts of the world. 
Page 28 



UARFCN (UTRA Absolute radio frequency channel number) 
UARFCN is an acronym that stands for UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number, where UTRA stands for UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access. These are used to identify frequencies in the UMTS frequency bands. 
UMTS {Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service) 
UMTS is a 3G transmission technology to support third generation mobile services e.g. video on a mobile handset. UMTS uses the same core network as the 2G GSM networks deployed worldwide, allowing dual-mode operation. 
USB {Universal Serial Bus) 
USB is a type of plug-in connection which connects electronic devices (including mobile handsets) to computers. In a mobile handset, USB is useful for quickly transferring files to and from phones, or for synchronizing address book and calendar information with a computer application such as Outlook. 
VLR (Visitor Location Register) 
The visitor location register (VLR) is a database of the subscribers who have roamed into the jurisdiction of the MSC (Mobile Switching Centre) which it serves. Each base transceiver station in the network is served by exactly one VLR; hence a subscriber cannot be present in more than one VLR at 

a time. 
VOiP (Voice over internet protocol) 
Voice over internet protocol is a technology which enables telephone signals to be carried (and therefore conversations to happen) via the internet. 
W�CDMA (Wideband Code Division /\/lultip/e Access) 
W-CDMA is used as the underlying air-interface within a UMTS system, using a pair of 5 MHz-wide radio channels for uplink and downlink transmission. W-CDMA supports voice, very high-speed multimedia services such as full-motion video, Internet access and video conferencing. W-CDMA transmits on a pair of 5 MHz-wide radio channels 
1/1/i-Fi Wireless Fidelity, also known as Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and 802.lla/b/g/n. Wi-Fi provides short-range, high-speed connections between mobile devices (mobiles, PDAs, laptops) and nearby hardware such as Wi-Fi access points which are connected to the wired network

Introduction 
tness 
[1] I am an expert in Cell Site Analysis and Radio Frequency Surveying and have produced numerous reports and given evidence in court on many occasions. 
[2] I have been providing evidential products in relation to cell site and communication data for over 10 years. In the last 3 years I have been employed as a cell site and communications data expert working in the private sector and producing evidential reports and presenting evidence at court for both the prosecution and defence. 
[3] I have been fully trained in Cell Site Analysis and Radio Frequency Propagation Surveying (RFPS). I have presented cell site evidence at court in several high-profile cases. I was the North West Regional representative on the college of policing National RFPS user group. 
[4] I have been fully trained in the use of Csurv Munst, Csurv AP, Forensic Compass Cellular and Wi-Fi specialist equipment. 
[S] I am a qualified forensic mobile phone examiner. I have been conducting forensic examinations on mobile phones for over 10 years. I hold accreditation as an examiner from Microsystemations, lnvicta Forensics, and Cellebrite Forensics. I also hold a trainer's certificate from Cellebrite Forensics. I have also attended and passed the NPIA training courses in relation to mobile phone forensics. 
[6] This report relates to an investigation into the murder of Ian Ogle at approximately 21:20hrs on 27/01/19. This report aims to deal with issues surrounding the location of 3 mobile rhones attributed to the defendants in this case. 
[7] Provide commentary on the general location of 3 mobile phones attributed to defendants in this case around the times of sightingst/ CCTV of Black Seat Vehicle and indicate if the phone usage is consistent with being in the vicinity of any of the identified locations at the corresponding times.

[10] I have to the best of my knowledge and belief no connection with the defendants in this case. 
[11] Evidence for this report is based upon call events in the form of Call Data Records (CDRs). I have been provided with CDRs for the mobile phones attributed to the defendants in this investigation. 
[12] Network readings were undertaken on the 02 networks on the 9th March 2020 at the following locations: 
Pitt Place, Belfast Prince Albert Bar 356-359 Albertbridge Road, Belfast Langtry Court, Belfast. Cluan Place, Belfast. 14 Wye Street, Belfast 10 McArthur Court, Belfast 5 Newcastle Street, Belfast 
[13] An accompanying document containing Cell Site Analysis maps which are referenced in this document has also been produced. This is labelled exhibit reference: PSH4t-Cell Site Analysis Maps.

[14] In this report, the terms "Mobile Station" and "handset" should be considered to have the same meaning. Furthermore, the term "call event" is used to encompass a sent/received SMS and a made/received call. 
[15] For reasons of expediency the mobile telephones considered in this analysis are referred to using the last four digits of the associated telephone numbers. These numbers are also colour-coded throughout the report as detailed in the table below. It should be noted the numbering and colour used are purely to aid the ease of identification in this report and have no further significance beyond this point. 
[16] Important note -Any reference in this report to attribution of a specific mobile telephone number to an individual is merely due to the assertions submitted by prosecution.

[21] The call data at or as close as possible to 20:47hrs indicates that 0763, 2290 and 6614 are located in an area of Belfast which RFPS found to include the vicinity of Pitt Place where CCTV has been obtained relating to the Seat vehicle. It should be noted that the phones could also be located at any point within the coverage of the cell lDs utilised which also includes a number of other addresses significant in this investigation. GPRS sessions considered in the analysis of 0763 and 2290 are of durations which make it impossible to indicate with certainty the location of 0763 and 2290 at 20:47hrs. 
[22] The call data at or as close as possible to 21:09hrs indicates that 0763, 2290 and 6614 are located in an area of Belfast which RFPS found to include the vicinity of Wye Street where CCTV has been obtained relating to the Seat vehicle. It should be noted that the phones could also be located at any point within the coverage of the cell lDs utilised which also includes a number of other addresses significant in this investigation. The GPRS session considered in the analysis of 0763 is of a duration which make it impossible to indicate with certainty the location of 0763 at 21:19hrs. 
[23] The call data at or as close as possible to 21:16hrs indicates that 2290 and 6614 are located in an area of Belfast which RFPS found to include the vicinity of the Prince Albert Bar and Belvoir Street where CCTV has been obtained relating to the Seat vehicle. The cell utilised by 0763 was not found to provide coverage in the vicinity of the Prince Albert bar or Belvoir Street. It should be noted that the phones could also be located at any point within the coverage of the cell lDs utilised which also includes a number of other addresses significant in this investigation. GPRS sessions considered in the analysis of 0763 and 2290 are of durations which make it impossible to indicate with certainty the location of 0763 and 2290 at 21:16hrs. 
The call data at or as close as possible to 21:38hrs and 21:39hrs indicates that 0763 and 
2290 are located in an area of Belfast which RFPS found to include the vicinity of Pitt Place 
and the section of Ballymacarett Road near Blackthorn Foods where CCTV has been obtained 
relating to the Seat vehicle. Data indicates that 6614 was located in an area of Belfast which 
RFPS found to include the vicinity of Pitt Place but not the section of Ballymacarett Road 
near Blackthorn Foods. It should be noted that the phones could also be located at any point 
within the coverage of the cell lDs utilised which also includes a number of other addresses 
significant in this investigation. The GPRS session considered in the analysis of 0763 is of a 
duration which make it impossible to indicate with certainty the location of the 0763 at 
21:38hrs and 21:39hrs. 
[25] The call data at or as close as possible to 21:4Shrs indicates that 0763, 2290 and 6614 are located in an area of Belfast which RFPS found to include the vicinity of Pitt Place where CCTV has been obtained relating to the Seat vehicle. It should be noted that the phones could also be located at any point within the coverage of the cell lDs utilised which also includes a number of other addresses significant in this investigation. The GPRS session considered in the analysis of 0763 is of a duration which make it impossible to indicate with certainty the location of 0763 at 21:4Shrs. 
[26] In this case the significant locations are very close to one another. In these circumstances it is not possible to indicate a definite pattern of travel from the cell lDs utilised as these cells provide coverage to multiple locations and the travel is only over short distances.

Glossary 

2G 
In mobile telephony, 2G is short for second-generation wireless telephone technology. 2G networks supportencrypted voice and limited data communications. The predominant technology used in 2G networks is GSM. 2G offers additional services such as SMS. 
2,5G 
In mobile telephony, 2.SG protocols extend 2G systems to provide additional features such as packet.switched connection (GPRS) and enhanced data rates (EDGE). 
3G 
The third generation of mobile phone technologies, which builds upon 2G. 3G enables much faster connections to the Internet with enhanced multimedia experiences such as video messaging. The predominant technology used in 3G networks is UMTS. 
4G 
Fourth generation of mobile phone technologies which is based on Long Term Evolution (LTE). 4G offers even greater data rates than 3G and further enhanced services to subscribers. 
ARFCN {Absolute radio frequency channel number) 
In GSM cellular networks, an absolute radio-frequency channel number (ARFCN) is a code that specifies a pair of physical radio carriers and channels used for transmission and reception. 
Attenuation 
The decrease in the strength of a signal due to absorption and the redistribution of energy by objects 
i.e. buildings. 
Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 
BaseTransceiver Stations receive and transmit signals from mobile phones. They link mobiles to the rest of the mobile and land-line network. 
BCCH (Broadcast Control Channel) 
This downlink channel contains specific parameters needed by a mobile in order that it can identify the network and gain access to it. 
BER (Bit Error Rate) 
In telecommunication transmission, the bit error rate (BER) is the percentage of bits that have errors relative to the total number of bits received in a transmission, usually expressed as ten to a negative power. For example, a transmission might have a BER of 10 to the minus 6, meaning that, out of 1,000,000 bits transmitted, one bit was in error. 
Page 24 



BSIC {Base Station Identity Code) 
Base Station Identity Code (BSIC) is a unique code contained in messages on the broadcast channels of a cell or base station that uniquely identifies the base station. 
CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) 
CDMA is a form of multiplexing, which allows numerous signals to occupy a single transmission channel, optimizing the use of available bandwidth. 
Cellular Network 
Cellular radio is the technology that has made large scale mobile telephony possible. Current cellular networks can reuse the same radio frequencies by assigning them to cells far enough apart to reduce interference (2G). A cell is the geographical area covered by one radio base transceiver station. The size of each cell is determined by the terrain, transmission power, and forecasted number of users etc. Service coverage is achieved by an overlapping network of cells. 
Cell 
This is the physical geographical area served by a base transceiver station. Mobile networks are made up of cells which overlap each other. 
Ce/1 10 
A Cell ID (CID) is a generally unique number used to identify each Base transceiver station (BTS) or sector of a BTS within a Location area code (LAC) if not within a network. 
DDR data 
DDRs capture the cell details of the administrative messages (signalling) sent between the phone and the network. This messaging takes place even when the device isn't being used. It does however need to be turned on and connected to the network. The benefit of DDR data is that cell ID information is recorded in the times between calls/texts/data sessions. 
Digital In the context of mobile voice networks, voice is sampled and coded in preparation for transmission across the network. Digital networks are fast replacing analogue ones as they offer improved sound quality, secure transmission and error detection and correction. Digital networks include mobile systems and technologies such as GSM, CDMA, TOMA and UMTS. 

(Enhanced 
Rates for G.SM Evolution) 
EDGE is an enhanced modulation technique which increases network capacity and data rates in GSM networks, 
FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) 
FDMA gives users an individual allocation of one or several frequency bands, or channels. Multiple Access systems coordinate access between multiple users. The users may further share access via additional methods such as TOMA. 
Page 25 


GPRS {General Packet Radio Service) 
GPRS is a radio technology for GSM networks that adds packet-switching protocols, shorter set-up time for ISP connections, and offers the possibility to bill by amount of data sent rather than connect time. 
GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) 
GSM is a second-generation digital mobile cellular technology using a combination of frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TOMA). GSM is currently the most widely used digital mobile phone system and the de facto wireless telephone standard in Europe. This is the digital network that mobile phones utilise to make calls and send text messages. 
Handover 
The process used to describe the action of transferring a phone call from one base transceiver station to another as the caller moves around. 
r!LR {Home Location Register) 
The home location register (HLR) is a central database that contains details of each mobile phone subscriber that is authorised to use the GSM core network. The HLR stores details of every SIM card issued by the mobile phone operator. 
/MEI (lntemotional Mobile Equipment Identity) 
This is 15-digit number which identifies an individual phone to the network operators. The IMEI is only used for identifying the device and has no permanent or semi-permanent relation to the subscriber. 
IMS/ {lntemational Mobile Subscriber Identity) 
An International Mobile Subscriber Identity or IMSI is a unique identification associated with all GSM and UMTS network mobile phone users. It is stored as a 64 bit field in the SIM inside the phone and is sent by the phone to the network.
