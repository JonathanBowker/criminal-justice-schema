If you do say anything it may be given in evidence". I explained this in simple terms and Robert made no reply. At 19:26 hours I arrived at Musgrave Street PSNI station custody suite, after a short wait I introduced Robert to custody Sergeant Daly and explained the circumstances of the arrest.

I am the halt.sister of Alan Ervine, we have the same mother. On Monday 28th January 2019, I received a phone call from Alan's girlfriend, Paula Jackson. She phoned me at about 9.30 am, as far as I remember. Paula told me Alan needed a lift to the boat as he was going to Scotland for a few days to work. This was an unusual occurrence as I would not often be in East Belfast and wouldn't usually give Alan a lift anywhere, but I did not think anything of it at the time as I knew Alan had been working in the shipyards and had fallen out with his work colleagues. Neither Paula or Alan have a car so I agreed to pick him up. Paula told me to pick him up at the comer ofHumber Court, Belfast. I think it was atTanged for about I 0.30 am, I drove my white Audi Al, registration-, down to Humber Court. Alan was on the road with another guy who I didn't know. They both got into my car. Alan got in beside me and the other guy got in the back. Alan was wearing black tracksuit bottoms that had paint on them. They looked like work trousers. I don't remember what else he was wearing. I don't think he was carrying anything with him. The guy with him was of medium build, about 5'6"-5'7" tall, around 30 years old with a dark goatee beard and short dark hair. The only thing I remember about his clothes was that he was wearing a medium 




on the motorway to get there. Alan was quieter than usual on the journey. He just said he was going to work for a few days. He didn't say what he was going to do and I didn't ask anything more about it. I didn't hear the name of the other guy during the journey. He didn't say too much but he spoke with a local accent. I don't remember anything else discussed during the drive. It would have taken us about half an hour to get there. I dropped them both off at the docks. It was just outside the office you would go into to pay for your ticket. I did not make any arrangements to collect Alan. I have no memory of Alan or his friend taking or making any phone calls in my car. I 
headed on home at about 1o1.30 am or so that I checked Facebook and heard what had 
happened to Ian Ogle. Alan had not made any mention oflan Ogle during the car journey. I only heard Alan had been questioned by the Police when my other sister, 
Leanne Ervine, told me about it. I did not go and collect Alan from the docks when he came back to Belfast. The number l have for Paula Jackson is 11111I think she has changed her number since January. I have no record of her previous number. My number is 11111. I have had this number for 5 years.

These samples were exhibited as; MOS27 -Debris Driver's Footwell, MOS28 -Debris Front Passenger Footwell, MOS29 -Debris Rear Offside Footwell and MOS30 -Debris Rear Nearside Footwell. I finished my examination at 6.50pm. I later transferred the images from the SD card onto a disc and labelled the disc as MOS3 l -Master Disc. I indexed all 10 of the images taken. I then placed the aforementioned exhibits MOS! to MOS3 l in secure storage in the CS! Transit Store, PSNI Mahon Road. I returned to PSNI Ardmore on the 7th of February 2019 at 4.15pm in order to examine the vehicle for fingerprints. As a result ofmy examination I developed, marked and lifted latent prints from the vehicle labelled as follows; 1 a from the inside edge of the rear offside door, 1 b from the inside edge of the front passenger door and 2a on the media display screen.

I am a cousin of Glen Rainey. I would see him from time to time but he's away a lot. On several occasions in the past I have given him a lift to Dublin Airport or Belfast International Airpo1i. Sometimes I have notice and on other occasions it would be last minute. Glen would always pay me a few quid. On 28th January 20191 received a phonecall from Glen Rainey to my mobile phone. This would have been mid morning or a bit after. Glen asked could I do him a favour. I reckoned it would be a lift from past requests. Glen said it was a nm to Dublin Airport. He said he would ring me back to confirn1 a time for me to pick him up. Later that afternoon he rang back and told me to meet him on Mersey St. beside The Oval at around half six. I drive a black Nissan Quashqai VRM KGZ9666. I picked him up as mTanged. He was with Jonathan Brown who I didn't know was going to be there. I know him as Glen's friend but don't know him personally. There was very little chat going down in the car. Jonathan and Glen had a small case each. We talked about the best way to get to Dublin and then they fell asleep so it was a pretty boring journey. I dropped them at the tenninal. They gave me � 130 cash for the run. I joked with them not to be ringing me when they got back. 


Page 2 of2 I made no arrangements with them for the return journey to Belfast. I made my way 
back to Belfast. The next time I heard from Glen was when he was back in Belfast.

Examination Summary/Findings 
Item 44, JC16 consisted of a black handled kitchen type knife. The handle consisted of two scales attached to the tang of the knife with three rivets. The blade had a straight edge and bore the trade name "Ernesto". This item was labelled as being recovered from Conswater River near Mersey Street Bridge. 
Item 94, HK1 consisted of a black handled kitchen type knife. The handle consisted of two scales attached to the tang of the knife with three rivets. The blade had a straight edge and bore the trade name "Ernesto". This item was labelled as being recovered from the kitchen of Flat 1, 20 Mersey Street. 
Item 95, PW19 consisted three black handled knives and a sharpening steel. Each knife had a different sized and shaped blade but bore a similarly constructed handle which comprised two scales attached to the tang of the knife with three rivets. Each blade had a straight edge and bore the trade name "Frnesto". This item was labelled as being recovered from the kitchen of Flat 1, 20 Mersey Street. The 
�.,rpening steel bore no trade name. 
A comparison of the knife in item 44, JC16 with the knives in items 94, HK1 and 95, PW19 indicated that while the blades of the knives were of different lengths and shapes, their overall construction was similar. In addition each knife bore the same trade name "Ernesto". 
Correspondence with a retailer, Lidl, indicated they sold a set of knives bearing the trade name "Ernesto" and a sharpening steel visually similar to those noted in items 94, HK1 and 95, PW19. 
Item 108, JC17 consisted of a set of knives bearing the trade name "Ernesto". This set of knives was obtained from Lid!. This set comprised five knives of various sizes, a sharpening steal and a plastic cutting board. All the knives were constructed in a similar manor which consisted of two scales attached to the tang of the knife with three rivets. Each blade had a straight edge and bore the trade name "Ernesto". 
A comparison of the knife in item 44, JC16 with the knives in item 108, JC17 indicated that the knife in item 44, JC16 was of a similar size, construction and branding to the largest knife in the set, item 108, 1e7. 
A comparison of the knives and steel in items 94, HK1 and 95, PW19 with the knives in item 108, JC1e7 indicated that the knives and steel in items 94, HK1 and 95, PW19 were of a similar size, construction and branding to the four of the knives and steel in item 108, JC17. The fifth knife in item 108, JC17 was the knife that was similar to item 44, JC16. No cutting board was present in item 44, JC16 or items 94, HK1 and 95, PW19. 
Outline Assessment/Comment (value of evidential findings to support the court) 
The knife recovered from the river, item 44, JC16, while of a different length and shape of blade to those In items 94, HK1 and 95, PW19, was similar in terms of construction and bore the same trade name "Ernesto". 
FSNI: 486/19 Page 2 of 3 IPC: 637589175

OFFICIAL (When Complete) 

With the exception of the cutting board, the knife in item 44, JC16 and the knives and steel in items 94, 
HK1 and 95, PW19 were similar in terms of construction and bore the same trade name "Ernesto" to 
the knives and steel in item 108, JC17. 
I have considered the proposition that this knife was originally part of a set which included the knives 
and sharpening steel in items 94, HK1 and 95, PW19; the results of my examination provide support 
for this proposition. 
It is not possible to exclude the possibility that item 44, JC1 6 originated from an alternative set of knives. For this to be the case, that set of knives would need to be of similar design and construction and bear the same trade name as the knives in items 94, HK1 and 95, PW19.

I am a Detective Constable in the Police Service ofNorthem Ireland presently attached to Crime Operations Department. 
I have attended and completed the PSNI Core Skills for Mobile Device Examinations Course. I have also been certified in the use of the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED) made by Cellebrite and completed the Cellebrite Certified Logical Operators (CCLO) Course. 
On 6th February 2019 I seized exhibit SW I, an Apple iPhone mobile phone from Jonathan Brown. I signed and dated the exhibit label accordingly. On 7th February 2019 this exhibit was assigned Case Reference P00l919C201. I then commenced an examination of this exhibit.

Page2 of5 I conducted the examination ofexhibit SWl using a Faraday Box which prevents a 
mobile device accessing Cellular and Wi-Fi networks. 
I then extracted data from the handset and SIM Card using forensic software. 
During my examination ofexhibit SW! I identified data on the exhibit deemed pertinent by the investigating officer, Detective Constable Cairns. I produced details ofthese entries in report format. It is noted that the SIM card used in this handset is an AIS Sim card which is a Mobile phone service provider based in Thailand, the handset was set to UTC + 7 hrs, Bangkok which is consistent with this handset having been in Thailand. 
At the end ofmy examination I returned the exhibit to EDO Helen Hoffin.

I have attended and completed the PSNJ Core Skills for Mobile Device Examinations Course. I have also been certified in the use of the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED) made by Cellebrite and completed the Cellebrite Certified Logical Operators (CCLO) Course. 
On 30th January 2019 at 14:30 hrs I received exhibit JBI, a Samsung mobile phone from Detective Constable Bingham, of MIT2. I signed and dated the exhibit label accordingly. This exhibit was assigned Case Reference P00l419C201. I then commenced an examination of this exhibit. 





I conducted the examination of exhibit JB I using a Faraday Box which prevents a 
mobile device accessing Cellular and Wi-Fi networks. 
I then extracted data from the handset and SIM Card using forensic software. 
During my examination of exhibit JB I I identified data on the exhibit deemed pertinent by the investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Cairns. I produced details of these entries in report format. 
At the end of my examination I returned the exhibit to EDO Helen Hoffin. 
GLOSSARY OF TERMS 
!MEI (International Mobile Equipment Identifier) -This is a unique number given to each handset. This is usually printed somewhere on the handset, (typically in the battery compartment) and stored electronically in the phone handset memory. 
SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) -Essentially a small computer on a card that sits within the mobile phone and controls various functions of call making. It also has enough memory to hold information such as AON and SMS. 





MSISDN (Mobile Station ISDN Number) -This number is the standard international number used to identify a given subscriber. However, the number stored in the MSISDN location on a SIM Card can be changed without affecting the actual telephone number. Therefore, the MS ISDN number downloaded from the SIM card can only be used as an indicator. 
ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) -The serial number of the SIM card stored electronically within the SIM. A similar number or shortened version is often found printed on the SIM card. 
IMS! (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) -This is a unique number allocated to each mobile phone subscriber, stored electronically within the SIM Card. It is used by the network to look up the telephone number associated to the SIM Card. 
PIN (Personal Identification Number) -The SIM card has been locked against unauthorised access using the PIN number. When PIN security is activated, the correct PIN number must be entered in order to use any of the features of the handset (make calls, access ADN etc.). The only calls that can be made without a PIN are calls to the emergency services. 
PUK (Personnel Unblocking Key) -if the PIN is unknown the PUK is used to unblock the SIM card and enable a new PIN code to be entered. 
SMS (Short Message Service) -SMS is a form of textual conversation permitted by a network carrier. The service allows a user to send and receive textual messages direct to their handsets. The storage capacity depends on the handset and SIM. The date and 



Page 4 of6 time ofreceived messages is generated by the network, all other date and time stamps are generated from the handset time. The maximum character length is 160 per SMS. Some handsets allow longer messages to be compiled and therefore are split into relevant parts when sent, these messages are known as concatenated. 
Deleted SMS (Short Message Service) -These are text messages that have been deleted from the SIM card by the cell phone user. However, most mobile phones do not remove the message, but mark the message to be overwritten by incoming messages from the network. 
MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) -A service which allows Multimedia messages to be sent from one mobile to another via one or more call centres or network providers. A Multimedia message is stored on the handset and can contain a combination of text, video clips, images and sound clips. 
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) -a digital mobile telephone system that is widely used in Europe and other parts of the world. GSM uses a variation of time division multiple access (TDMA) and is the most widely used of the three digital wireless telephone technologies (TDMA, GSM, and CDMA). 
LAI (Location Area Identity) A code that identifies the location area in a PLMN. The 
LAI code has three components: MCC-MNC-LAC. 
MCC (Mobile Country Code) -The MCC is a 3-digit code that uniquely identifies the country of domicile of the mobile subscriber (for example, Germany is 262, and Brunei is 528).

MNC (Mobile Network Code) -The MNC is a 2-digit code that identifies the home GSM PLMN of the mobile subscriber. If more than one GSM PLMN exists in a country, a unique MNC is assigned to each of them. The government of each country assigns it. 
LAC (Location Area Code) -The LAC component identifies a location area within a PLMN; it has a fixed length of2 octets and can be coded using hexadecimal representation. An operator assigns it. 
ADN (Abbreviated Dialling Numbers) -more commonly known as the phonebook or contacts.

Further to my statement dated 21 st January 2020. Following consultation with Crown Counsel. I have made changes to maps NRK4, NRK5 and NRK6. The maps now show the location of each CCTV camera labelled A -T with details in a key on each Map and where possible I have shown the general direction in which each camera is pointing. I have reproduced the amended maps which are now labelled Police ID Nos NRK4a, NRK5a and NRK6a respectively. I also produced a further map, labelled Police ID No NRK7, showing the area of Wolff Close, Harland Walk and Fraser Pass, to a scale of I :500 on which I have also shown CCTV camera locations and directionality. These maps are all marked PSNI Ref. CC2019012701303 and Mapping Ref. 056/19.

On 01/05/2019 I identified a male I know to be Mark Sewell Date ofBirth I 0/12/1o978 from CCTV footage. I wish to clarify that the reason I know Mark Sewell is from an incident on 9/04/2019. I noticed a car acting suspiciously in the area of Dee Street Belfast. I stopped this Mercedes vehicle registration VUI7837 in Wye Street Belfast at 1350 hours and had reason to search it under the Misuse ofDrugs Act 1971 due to the behaviour ofthe occupants. The passenger in the vehicle was Mark Sewell. He was not happy about the search and was argumentative throughout. I personally searched him and dealt with him for approximately twenty minutes until around l 410 hours.

a Judge's Commendation for my work in these areas. 
Prior to my appointment at Acuity Forensics I was employed at TRL for seven and a half years as a Principal Consultant and finally as Head of the Video Inverstigations Unit, specialising in vehicle identification and incident reconstruction. Before that I was employed by West Mercia Constabulary in the Headquarters Imaging Unit; there I undertook the processing and enhancement of video and provided expert reports to assist major investigations. 
Before this I was the Senior Video, Audio and Imaging Expert at the Bureau of Forensic Science. My work involved the analysis, examination and production of video and audio evidence for the Court; this included the provision of Expert reports and Expert evidence at Court on behalf of both Defence and Prosecution, in this country and overseas. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 I have been asked by DC Charlene SPEER of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to consider CCTV imagery in connection with a police enquiry in the murder of Ian Ogle. 
1.2 On Monday 20 January 2020, a package was received at the offices at Acuity Forensics Ltd, delivered Royal Mail 'signed for' delivery. 
1.3 In this package were the following items: 
A Kingston 16 Gb USB stick drive containing: Files from the following exhibits CS/7, CS/4, CS/I 1, LW/11 and LW/2. 





A word document providing the times for the sightings and setting out the quality of each sighting. 
A printed copy of an email thread. 
1.4 On Monday 24 February 2020 I received two emails from DC SPEER. Each one had still images of a vehicle of interest to the investigation attached, one a dark tone, third generation Seat Leon registration number JGZ7406 and the other a white BMW3 series (F30), registration KRZ7426. 1 only received these images once I had finished my blind analysis. 
1.5 In this case, as is my normal practice, in line with what is considered to be 'best practice' by myself, having taken into account the opinions of various cognitive psychologists, I conducted my analysis of the vehicle sightings without any prior knowledge of any possible vehicle identities (i.e. vehicles seized by the investigation team or vehicles known to be used by potential suspects, victims or witnesses). This was in order to avoid a phenomenon known as confirmation bias, the subconscious tendency of all humans to confirm the identity of a known target when presented with limited information. 
1.6 At the time of writing this statement the above items remain in my possession. 
1.7 
Unless otherwise stated the times given are the displayed times from the CCTV system. 

2. 
VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION 


2.1 The first sighting I have been directed to is seen on exhibit CS/4 (Clip 002 from the schedule) AT 20:45:17. The vehicle is seen parked on the right of the screen, its hazard lights are seen to flash and then the vehicle moves offand turns left before being lost from view. The vehicle is very small in frame and is poorly lit, resulting in very little detail being captured. 


Page 4 of 15 2.1.1. The vehicle seen is a dark tone. 
2.1.2. Its taillights have a horizontal appearance and are at the waistline of the vehicle. 
2.1.3. The vehicle has a low mounted rear number plate. 
2.1.4. The high-level brake light is mounted at the top of the rear screen. 
2.1.5. Little else is reliably rendered by the recording system. 
2.1.6. In my opinion, it is not possible to positively identify this vehicle from these images alone, however it is a vehicle like a Mk6 or 7 Volkswagen Golf, a Volkswagen Passat 87 or 88, a second-generation BMWl series Mk2 or a third generation Seat Leon. 
2.2 The second sighting I have been directed to is seen on exhibit CS/4 (Clip 007 from the schedule) AT 21 :37:07. The vehicle is seen turning left into the road at the right of the frame and then it parks at the side of the road on the right of the screen, its hazard lights are seen to flash after the driver gets out of the vehicle. The vehicle is very small in frame and is poorly lit, resulting in very little detail being captured. 
2.2.1. The vehicle seen is dark in tone. 
2.2.2. The vehicle has a conventionally mounted front number plate, on the front bumper. 
2.2.3. The way the indicators flash with little or no ramp up or down is consistent with LED indicators rather than incandescent. 

2.2.4. Little else is reliably rendered by the recording system. 
2.2.5. In my opinion, it is not possible to positively identify this vehicle from these images alone.

2.5.7. In my opinion, it is not possible to positively identify this vehicle from these images alone, however it is a vehicle like a second-generation BMW! series Mk2, a third generation Seat Leon or another similar vehicle. 
2.6. The sixth sighting I have been directed to is seen on exhibit CS/I I (Clips 003 from the schedule) AT 2 I :45: 17. The vehicle is seen travelling from left to right on two cameras. The vehicle is relatively large in frame but is poorly lit, resulting in only some detail being captured. 
2.6.1. The vehicle seen is a dark tone hatchback. 
2.6.2. The headlights wrap into the front wing to some degree, and the trailing edge leans backwards, with the upper comer intruding further back than the lower. 
2.6.3. The vehicle has auxiliary lights which light as it turns a comer. 
2.6.4. The front number plate is mounted conventionally on the bumper.

2.6.12. In my opinion, based on the overall profile, the appearance ofthe tail lights, the juxtaposition ofthe rear lights and the rear number plate and the position ofthe reflectors in the valance, the vehicle is most likely to be a dark tone third generation Seat Leon. 
2.6.13. I cannot totally rule out the possibility it is a second-generation BMW! series, but ifit is it must be fitted with the 'M Sport" rear valance. 
2.7. The seventh sighting I have been directed to is seen on exhibit CS/I I (Clips 009 and 010 from the schedule) between 22:57:48 and 23:05:38.

3.3. I then compared these dark tone vehicle sightings with the vehicle in the images sent to me on the 24 February 2020 of the Seat Leon JGZ7406. Jn all cases the vehicle of interest is consistent with the sightings within the limitations of the imagery. 
3.4. I can find no reason to exclude any of the sightings from being this vehicle. 
3.5. In my opinion, some or all of the sightings of a dark tone vehicle I have been directed to could be the vehicle of interest. 
3.6. I then compared the two sightings I have been directed to of a light tone, probably white BMW3 series and they are entirely consistent with each other, within the limitations of the imagery. 
3.7. In my opinion, it is likely the two sightings are of one and the same vehicle due to the sightings being on the same system and the close timings of the two sightings. 
3.8. I cannot totally rule out the possibility of two almost identical vehicles being in the same location with a few minutes of each other. 
3.9. I then compared these two sightings with the reference images of the BMW3 series registration KRZ7426. Jn both cases the vehicle of interest is consistent with the sightings within the limitations of the imagery.

3. I I.Jn my opinion, one or both of the sightings of a light tone BMW3 series I have been directed to could be the vehicle of interest. 
4 CONCLUSIONS 
4.1. In my opinion, all the dark tone vehicles I have been directed to could be or are consistent with a third generation Seat Leon.

I am employed by The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland, part of the Bank of Ireland Group (the "Bank"), whose office is at One Temple Quay, Bristol, BS 1 9HY. I am authorised to make this statement on behalf of the Bank. 
I make this statement in addition to my statement of 111 " June 20 19. 
I have access to computer and documentary records compiled by the Bank during the ordinary course of daily business relating to customer accounts. 
From these records I can confirm that the Bank holds a personal current account, number 27648640 90-22-23, in the name of Glenn Rainey (DOB: 27/03/1986) of 1 O McArthur Court, Belfast BT 4 1 BA. 
I can confirm that due to the passage of time, the Branch has been unable to supply the clocket that was completed when Mr Rainey made the cash withdrawal of �3,000.00 on 23rd January 2019 from account number 27648640 90-22-23. The docket would have provided the date and time of the withdrawal. 
The Branch has confirmed the following in relation to cash withdrawals: 
The withdrawal would not have been made by cheque, it was a cash withdrawal made either with his visa debit card (VDC) or by him completing a withdrawal docket. 
If Mr Rainey used his VDC he would have been ID'd through inputting his PIN code. If he completed a withdrawal docket, we would have taken a form of photographic ID from him and noted this on the bac/( ofthe docket. 
Ourpolicy around withdrawals is that any withdrawal over �2k is signed off by an authorised signatory who would check the account operation and sign the back of

I conducted the examination of exhibit JM2 using a Faraday Box which prevents a mobile device accessing Cellular and Wi-Fi networks. 
I then extracted data from the handset and SIM Card using forensic software. 

During my examination of exhibit JM2 I identified data on the exhibit deemed petiinent by the investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Cairns. I produced details of these entries in report format. 
At the end of my examination I returned the exhibit to EDO Helen Hoffin. 
GLOSSARY OF TERMS 
IMEi (International Mobile Equipment Identifier) -This is a unique number given to each handset. This is usually printed somewhere on the handset, (typically in the battery compartment) and stored electronially in the phone handset memory. 
SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) -Essentially a small computer on a card that sits within the mobile phone and controls various functions of call making. It also has enough memory to hold infonnation such as AON and SMS. 
MSISDN (Mobile Station ISDN Number) -This number is the standard international number used to identify a given subscriber. However, the number stored in the MSISDN location on a SIM Card can be changed without affecting the actual 



Page 3 of5 telephone number. Therefore, the MSISDN number downloaded from the SIM Card 
can only be used as an indicator. 
ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) -The serial number of the SIM card stored electronically within the SIM. A similar number or shortened version is often found printed on the SIM card. 

IMS! (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) -This is a unique number allocated to each mobile phone subscriber, stored electronically within the SIM card. It is used by the network to look up the telephone number associated to the SIM Card. 
PIN (Personal Identification Number) -The SIM card has been locked against unauthorised access using the PIN number. When PIN security is activated, the correct PIN number must be entered in order to use any of the features of the handset (make calls, access AON etc.). The only calls that can be made without a PIN are calls to the emergency services. 
PUK (Personnel Unblocking Key) -If the PIN is unknown the PUK is used to unblock the SIM card and enable a new PIN code to be entered. 
SMS (Short Message Service) -SMS is a form of textual conversation permitted by a network carrier. The service allows a user to send and receive textual messages direct to their handsets. The storage capacity depends on the handset and SIM. The date and time of received messages is generated by the network, all other date and time stamps are generated from the handset time. The maximum character length is 160 per SMS. 


relevant parts when sent, these messages are known as concatenated. 

Deleted SMS (Short Message Service) -These are text messages that have been deleted from the SIM card by the cell phone user. However most mobile phones do not remove the message, but mark the message to be overwritten by incoming messages from the network. 
MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) -a service which allows Multimedia messages to be sent from one mobile to another via one or more call centres or network providers. A multimedia message is stored on the handset and can contain a combination of text, video clips, images and sound clips. 
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) -a digital mobile telephone system that is widely used in Europe and other parts of the world. GSM uses a variation of time division multiple access (TOMA) and is the most widely used of the three digital wireless telephone technologies (TOMA, GSM, and CDMA). 
LAI (Location Area Identity) A code that identifies the location area in a PLMN. The LAI code has three components: MCC-MNC-LAC. 
MCC (Mobile Country Code) -the MCC is a 3-digit code that uniquely identifies the country of domicile of the mobile subscriber (for example, Germany is 262, and Brunei is 528). 



Page 5 of5 MNC (Mobile Network Code) -The MNC is a 2-digit code that identifies the home GSM PLMN of the mobile subscriber. If more than one GSM PLMN exists in a country, a unique MNC is assigned to each of them. The government of each country assigns it. 
LAC (Location Area Code) -The LAC component identifies a location area within a PLMN; it has a fixed length if2 octets and can be coded using hexadecimal representation. An operator assigns it. 
AON (Abbreviated Dialling Numbers) -more commonly known as the phonebook or contacts.

SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) -Essentially a small computer on a card that sits within the mobile phone and controls various functions of call making. It also has enough memory to hold infonnation such as AON and SMS. 
MSISDN (Mobile Station ISDN Number) -This number is the standard international 
number used to identify a given subscriber. However, the number stored in the 
MSISDN location on a SIM Card can be changed without affecting the actual 
telephone number. Therefore, the MSISDN number downloaded from the SIM card can only be used as an indicator. 
ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) -The serial number of the SIM card stored electronically within the SIM. A similar number or shortened version is often found printed on the SIM card. 

IMS! (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) -This is a unique number allocated to each mobile phone subscriber, stored electronically within the SIM Card. It is used by the network to look up the telephone number associated to the SlM Card. 
PIN (Personal Identification Number) -The SIM card has been locked against unauthorized access using the PIN number. When PIN security is activated, the correct PIN number must he entered in order to use any of the features of the handset (make calls, access AON etc.) The only calls that can be made without a PIN are calls to the emergency services. 


PUK (Personnel Unblocking Key) -If the PIN is unknown the PUK is used to unblock the SIM card and enable a new PIN code to be entered. 



SMS (Short Message Service) -SMS is a form of textual conversation permitted by a network carrier. The service allows a user to send and receive textual messages direct to their handsets. The storage capacity depends on the handset and SIM. The date and time ofreceived messages is generated by the network, all other date and time stamps are generated from the handset time. The maximum character length is 160 per SMS. Some handsets allow longer messages to be compiled and therefore are split into relevant parts when sent, these messages are known as concatenated. 
Deleted SMS (Short Message Service) -These are text messages that have been deleted from the SIM card by the cell phone user. However, most mobile phones do not remove the message, but mark the message to be overwritten by incoming messages from the network. 

MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) -A service which allows Multimedia messages to be sent from one mobile to another via one or more call centres or network providers. A Multimedia message is stored on the handset and can contain a combination of text, video clips, images and sound clips. 
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) -a digital mobile telephone system that is widely used in Europe and other parts of the world. GSM uses a variation of time division multiple access (TDMA) and is the most widely used of the three digital wireless telephone technologies (TDMA, GSM, and CDMA). 



LAI (Location Area Identity) A code that identifies the location area in a PLMN. The LAI code has three components: MCC-MNC-LAC. 



MCC (Mobile Country Code) -The MCC is a 3-digit code that uniquely identities 
the country of domicile of the mobile subscriber (for example, Germany is 262, and 
Brunei is 528). 

MNC (Mobile Network Code) -The MNC is a 2-digit code that identifies the home GSM PLMN of the mobile subscriber. If more than one GSM PLMN exists in a country, a unique MNC is assigned to each of them. The government of each country assigns it. 
LAC (Location Area Code) -The LAC component identifies a location area within a PLMN; it has a fixed length of2 octets and can be coded using hexadecimal representation. An operator assigns it. 
ADN (Abbreviated Dialling Numbers) -more commonly known as the phonebook or contacts.

I am a Detective Constable in the Police Service of Northern Ireland currently attached to the Major Investigation Team, Ladas Drive Police Station. On Wednesday 30th January 2019 I downloaded CCTV from 23 Frome Street, Belfast which I later marked CS 11. On Thursday 31 st January 2019 I returned to 23 Frome Street and downloaded further CCTV footage which I later marked CS20. Upon review of the CCTV recordings it appears that the system has been set only to record when movement is detected as the footage is not continuous and within every recorded file there is some form of movement within the picture frame. This is a common feature ofCCTV systems as it saves on data storage space.

I am a Detective Constable in the Police Service of Northern Ireland presently attached to MIT, C2 Crime Operations Department located at Ladas Drive Police Complex, Belfast. Fmiher to my previous statements regarding Diligence Forensics I would like to highlight that a working copy of CCTV CS8 was not provided to Diligence for comparison analysis, this was an error in my statement dated 30/10/20. Also CS27 and CS28 which had been included on the initial USB given to Matthew Stephens were not included for comaparison analysis by Mark Buxton. I would also like to confirm that folder 7 on CS69 relates to the a black car. No comparison work was requested in relation to this paticular segment ofCS7. Folder 18 on CS69 related to a white car and again no comaprison was requested in relation to this vehicle. Vehicle comparison was completed by Acuity Forensics.

On Saturday 1st July 2017 I was having a few drinks with my girlfriend Chelsea Bradley and a few friends as the bands were out. We had a few drinks at my friend Martin Moore's house and then we went onto the Con Club on the Newtownards Road, Belfast for a few more drinks. At approximately 2300-2330 hours on l :7: 17 Chelsea, Ryan Ogle and myself went to the Albert Bar on the Albertbridge Road again for some drinks. We all sat on the far right hand side of the bar near the exit to the smoking area. At some point another friend, Marcus Davison joined our company. Also Colin Ogle who is Ryan Ogle's uncle was sat at the same table. Lisa Duffield who is family of the Ogles was working behind the bar. It was pretty messy and shots of spirits were consumed. The atmosphere was great and we were messing about taking photographs and generally having a good time. Having lived in the area for about 15 years I would have known a lot of people drinking in the bar. A person I know as Saucy (Glenn Rainey) was in the bar that night. He was with another male called Jonny Brown and Bo (Alan Ervine). I would know these people through mutual friends and living in the area. I noticed at some point Glenn Rainey head out towards the smoking area. At this time I was sitting beside Ryan Ogle. I'm near sure Colin

exactly of the time but I'm sure it was some time around 2 am or 3 am on 2:7: 17. I remember Glenn Rainey coming over to our table and start on Ryan asking him was he firing him dirty looks and offering him a fight outside. Ryan went to get up but before he could get up Saucyjust started firing punches towards his face. I don't know whether these punches connected but I instinctively rugby tackled Saucy onto the pool table to try to separate them. From the way Saucy behaved it was clear to me that he was on drugs. He was very aggressive and full ofrage, hyped up and generally wanting to kill dead things. By the time I was turning to face Ryan again I could see Jonny Brown stamping repeatedly on Ryan's head. Chelsea and Lisa Duffield were on either side of Jonny trying to pull Jonny off. Ryan was lying across the bar seat. I then remember being out the back of the bar and we were checking on Ryan's injury's to see how bad they were. Ryan was phoning his sister and parents at this stage. Colin Ogle had come out as well, seen the state of Ryan and went back into the bar. I remained with Ryan. Ryan was on the phone with his sister who was hysterical and it was clear that she had made her way to the front of the Albert Bar and was kicking the door as it was closed. Ryan, Chelsea and I ran round to Toni as she was kicking the door. Things are a little bit fussy at this stage but I am near sure that because the door was being kicked someone opened it. Ryan's mum and dad had by now arrived and I walked towards them to explain what had happened to Ryan. Ryan, Ian, Toni and possibly Vera then went in through the front door of the Albeti. I then entered the bar and as I did so a glass bottle just missed me and smashed off the wall beside me. A bar stool then went flying by me. I seen Saucy, Jonny Brown, Greg Edgar and Ryan Davison firing anything they could get their hands on towards all the Ogles. Bo Ervine's girlfriend launched a bottle towards Ryan but this just missed him. Toni seen this and she grabbed her and flung her out of the way. Next thing I remember was Ryan Davison punching Toni in the face. Toni punched him back until they were separated by someone. This was essentially a mini riot in a bar which lasted for I 0 minutes maximum, Things ended up spilling out by the side of the Con Club. Just before this I seen Bo Ervine and Ryan Ogle exchanging punches in the bar. This was from one side of the bar to the other. There was more fighting outside between Saucy and Ryan with Saucy being the aggressor each time. Ian was arguing with Jonny, and 



Page 3 of3 Greg Edgar. Saucy then started antagonising Ian Ogle and ended up hitting him twice on the face. Ian sarcastically clapped saying "Very good, very good", which angered Saucy. Saucy then lifted a house brick and was about to attack Ian but he thought better of it as Ian quickly got out of the way. Someone shouted Police and we could see lights so everyone kind of dispersed. I was slightly injured in that something hit me on the back of the head but it was clear that Ryan was beat to a pulp. We took him to Colin and Lisa Duffield's house and got Ryan fixed up. I later went home. I ultimately believe that the incident in the Albert Bar on lst-2nd July 2017 was the main reason why Ian Ogle was murdered. It started the feud.
