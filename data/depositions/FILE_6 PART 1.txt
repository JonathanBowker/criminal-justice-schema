Or knowledge of it. 
No comment. 
Okay then emm Chris you, as I've said at the start of this interview then you've been, this is your fourth interview and again you've chosen to give us no comment so I'm going to go through basically to try and demonstrate why you're here okay and if it any point again you want to offer any explanation to us I would advise you to, to tell us and again as we've said before facts are checkable you know where you were, possibly CCTV, your car, any alibis any people you were with okay and as I've said then nine or sorry 

8.50 pm Neil Ogle is assaulted outside the Spence's chippy on the Beersbridge Road okay. Again we're not saying you were there but it turns to a sequence of events okay. So 8.50 and then at twenty one or sorry 9.30 pm Ian Ogle is assaulted, badly beaten and stabbed outside his house in Cluan Place by approximately five plus males okay where he dies, where he's murdered and again I'm not saying you're there, you're not arrested for murder but what becomes significant then is what happens after. As I've asked you several times Jon Jonathan Brown or his in your case you have him as John Brown in your phone, JD1 but at five past ten that night, 35 minutes later you receive a call from John Brown on your phone that lasts 16 seconds and we've asked you to account for that and again I'm going to ask you again what was discussed in that call.

As I said there's another of other suspects still out there, the murder weapon is still out there. 
My client's clear as to why he's here and he doesn't have to answer any questions.

These are photographs emm that the person who's doing the physical examination of your phone takes as he's doing it okay. These are just copies okay from the triage report. So this is, your phone is obviously se, hand, when you hand it in its seized from yourself, it's placed in the police evidence bag okay emm so they open it up and take pictures as they go along okay.

Okay so I'm just. I can see it. Going to play on here emm you can see now you can see the

footage will be sent to experts to try and help us to identify your car as your, as that is your car and factors like you using your indicator will assist us okay. 
You can see here that there's something going on over at the, the front of 1o4 Wye Street there and we believe that to be a male leaving again Mr Hands. I appreciate the car's not there at this stage. 
Yeah I know, I know that's fine. I'm iust lettina. No, no that's fine. Know what's happening there okay. Emm hmm. So then we've moved onto 23 thirt, 2233 hours and again it's the 

same camera okay. You can see that there's occupants leaving 1o4 Wye Street which is just a couple of minutes after you've, you've pulled off here. 
Emm hmm. 
And as I've said eh to remind you that's where police believe the clean-up of this murder happened afterwards. So this male running across the road in shorts with a bag in his 
hand, police believe to be Jonathan Brown and you can see then from the other angle camera that we showed you at the start eh this white, what police believe to be a BMW driving down the street again, so I'm just going to pause here, bear with me okay.

SOLICITOR And that's supposed to be the same vehicle. Yes. SOLICITOR As. We believe, police believe this is the same vehicle. Now you can see this male getting into the passenger side of the vehicle 
wearing shorts so we believe they've changed and they've got a bag in them so. Emm hmm and we know it's Jonathan Brown. (Inaudible). That we would argue it's Jonathan Brown because there's earlier 
CCTV in relation to himself leaving his home address in and around quarter to ten okay in shorts okay, so that's why we say that's Jonathan Brown and that's Jonathan Brown getting back into your car. 

SOLICITOR CCTV of Mr Brown leaving his own house. Yeah and checked. SOLICITOR After the time of the murder. Yeah. SOLICITOR Okay. He's gone back to his house in. SOLICITOR He's gone back to his house. Ah ha.

At five past ten Jonathan Brown is ringing you okay shortly after the a violent murder okay, so it's not going to be just a, a friendly chat okay. He then phones you again at twelve minutes past ten okay, again eh 2 minutes later at 2214 your vehicle is eh sighted on the Newtownards Road in East Belfast putting you there because you're not giving us any answer, so we suspect it is you there and we suspect it is you picking up Jonathan Brown under his orders or at his request and then you drop him at 2221 by that CCTV at 14 Wye Street okay, where he goes in for 7 to 8 minutes, removes a bag which police believe may be the weapons involved in this murder or something to do with this murder and you drive your car and take him away with those items. Okay and you're assisting Jonathan throughout and you've given nothing to us to dispute that. Is there anything you wish to tell us about your involvement.

As I said we believe it's Jonathan Brown because his, this earlier CCTV would match his clothing. Oh yeah. 
Yeah. But I we know that clothing isn't ideal you know it can be part of it, part of the case but that's all that all these things are things that police believe at this stage, unless anything changes but we're.
